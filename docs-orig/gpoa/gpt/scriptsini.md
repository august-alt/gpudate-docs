## FunctionDef read_scripts(scripts_file)
 **read\_scripts**: The function of read\_scripts is to read a scripts file and populate a Scripts\_lists object with Script objects based on the contents of the file.

**parameters**:
· scripts\_file: A string representing the file path of the scripts file to be read.

**Code Description**:
The read\_scripts function takes a single parameter, scripts\_file, which is the file path of the scripts file to be read. It first creates an instance of the Scripts\_lists class, which will manage and store the Script objects created from the scripts file.

Next, it initializes four empty dictionaries to store the logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown scripts, respectively. These dictionaries will be populated with Script objects as the function reads the scripts file.

The function then reads the scripts file using a ConfigParser object and iterates through the sections and keys to create Script objects based on the action type and script filename. The script objects are then added to the corresponding action dictionary (logon, logoff, startup, or shutdown) based on their action type.

Finally, the function returns the Scripts\_lists object, which now contains the Script objects created from the scripts file.

The read\_scripts function is called by the pref\_parsers function in the gpoa/gpt/gpt.py/pref\_parsers module. The pref\_parsers function creates a dictionary of parser functions for different types of files, and read\_scripts is the parser function for scripts files.

The read\_scripts function is responsible for creating Script objects based on the contents of a scripts file, and it is a crucial part of the project as it allows scripts to be added to the appropriate lists based on the action. This is important for managing and executing scripts based on the action.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the scripts file should be a valid file path to ensure that the function can read the file. If an invalid file path is passed, the function will not be able to create any Script objects and will return an empty Scripts\_lists object.

Additionally, the scripts file should be formatted correctly with the appropriate sections and keys for each script. If the scripts file is not formatted correctly, the function may not be able to create the correct Script objects and may return an incomplete Scripts\_lists object.

The following is an example of how the read\_scripts function may be called:
```python
scripts = read_scripts('/path/to/scripts/file')
```
In this example, the read\_scripts function is called with the file path of the scripts file as a parameter. The function will read the scripts file and return a Scripts\_lists object containing the Script objects created from the file.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of the output of the read\_scripts function:
```python
Scripts_lists object containing the following Script objects:
- Logon Script 1: /path/to/logon/script/directory/script.bat
- Logon Script 2: /path/to/logon/script/directory/script2.bat
- Logoff Script 1: /path/to/logoff/script/directory/script.bat
- Startup Script 1: /path/to/startup/script/directory/script.bat
- Shutdown Script 1: /path/to/shutdown/script/directory/script.bat
```
In this example, the Scripts\_lists object contains five Script objects, each representing a different script based on the action type. The Script objects contain the action type, file path, and arguments for each script.
## FunctionDef merge_scripts(storage, sid, scripts_objects, policy_name)
 **merge\_scripts**: The function of merge\_scripts is to merge scripts from different policies into a single storage object.

**parameters**:
· `storage`: The storage object where the merged scripts will be added.
· `sid`: The unique identifier for the policy.
· `scripts_objects`: The object containing the scripts to be merged.
· `policy_name`: The name of the policy.

**Code Description**:
The function iterates over the logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown scripts in the `scripts_objects` object and adds each script to the `storage` object using the `add_script` method. The `sid` and `policy_name` are passed as arguments to the `add_script` method for each script added.

This function is used in the `pref_mergers` object in `gpoa/gpt/gpt.py` to merge scripts for different file types. It is called with the `merge_scripts` parameter set to the `merge_scripts` function, allowing it to merge scripts for the `FileType.SCRIPTS` file type.

**Note**:
- The `scripts_objects` parameter should be an object containing logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown scripts.
- The `storage` parameter should be a storage object that supports the `add_script` method.
- The `sid` and `policy_name` parameters should be unique identifiers and names for the policy being merged.
- The function does not validate the input parameters, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the parameters are valid.
- The function assumes that the `scripts_objects` parameter contains the necessary scripts, and does not handle cases where scripts are missing or invalid.
- The function does not return a value, and the merged scripts can only be accessed through the `storage` parameter.
- The function is not thread-safe and should not be called concurrently with the same `storage` parameter.
- The function may raise exceptions if the `add_script` method raises exceptions or if the input parameters are invalid. It is the responsibility of the caller to handle these exceptions.
## ClassDef Scripts_lists
 **Scripts\_lists**: The function of Scripts\_lists is to manage and store lists of scripts for different system actions such as logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown.

**Attributes**:
· `__logon_scripts`: A list to store the logon scripts.
· `__logoff_scripts`: A list to store the logoff scripts.
· `__startup_scripts`: A list to store the startup scripts.
· `__shutdown_scripts`: A list to store the shutdown scripts.

**Code Description**:
The Scripts\_lists class is initialized with four empty lists to manage scripts for different system actions. The class provides methods to get these lists and add scripts to them. The `add_script` method takes two parameters: `action` and `script`. The `action` parameter determines which list to add the `script` to, based on the value of `action` (LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP, or SHUTDOWN).

### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Scripts\_lists class and create empty lists for storing logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown scripts.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

The \_\_init\_\_ function is a special method in Python classes, called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class.

In this specific \_\_init\_\_ function, four empty lists are created as attributes of the Scripts\_lists class:

1. \_\_logon\_scripts: This list will store logon scripts.
2. \_\_logoff\_scripts: This list will store logoff scripts.
3. \_\_startup\_scripts: This list will store startup scripts.
4. \_\_shutdown\_scripts: This list will store shutdown scripts.

These lists will be used to manage and organize different types of scripts within the application.

**Note**:

- The \_\_init\_\_ function is automatically called when a new object is created from the Scripts\_lists class.
- Make sure to use self when referring to these lists within other methods of the Scripts\_lists class.
- The purpose of these lists is to manage and organize different types of scripts, so ensure that scripts are added to the appropriate list when working with the class.
***
### FunctionDef get_logon_scripts(self)
 **get\_logon\_scripts**: The function of get\_logon\_scripts is to return the list of logon scripts.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get\_logon\_scripts function is a simple method that returns the logon scripts list stored in the object's attribute `__logon_scripts`. This method does not contain any logic or computation, and its sole purpose is to provide access to the logon scripts list.

The `self` parameter in the function signature represents the instance of the object that the method is called on. Since this is an instance method, it can only be called on an object of the class that defines it.

The `return` statement returns the `__logon_scripts` attribute of the object, which is a list of logon scripts added using the `add_script` method.

From a functional perspective, `get_logon_scripts` plays a crucial role in the project by providing access to the logon scripts list. This list can be used by other parts of the program to perform actions on the logon scripts, such as executing them or modifying them.

**Note**: It is important to note that the `get_logon_scripts` method returns a reference to the `__logon_scripts` list, not a copy. Therefore, any modifications made to the list using the `add_script` method will be reflected in the list returned by `get_logon_scripts`.

**Output Example**:

Assuming that the `__logon_scripts` attribute contains the following values:
```python
['script1.bat', 'script2.bat', 'script3.bat']
```
The `get_logon_scripts` method will return the same list:
```python
['script1.bat', 'script2.bat', 'script3.bat']
```
This list can then be used by other parts of the program to perform actions on the logon scripts.
***
### FunctionDef get_logoff_scripts(self)
 **get\_logoff\_scripts**: This function is used to retrieve the list of logoff scripts.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function returns the `__logoff_scripts` attribute of the object. This attribute is expected to be a list containing all the logoff scripts added using the `add_script` function.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**: This function is used in the `add_script` function of the `gpoa/gpt/scriptsini.py/Scripts_lists/add_script` object to add scripts to the appropriate list based on the action. When the action is 'LOGOFF', the script is added to the `__logoff_scripts` list, which can be retrieved using the `get_logoff_scripts` function.

**Note**: The `get_logoff_scripts` function does not add scripts to the list. It only retrieves the list. To add scripts, use the `add_script` function with the 'LOGOFF' action.

**Output Example**:
```python
['script1.bat', 'script2.bat', 'script3.bat']
```
In this example, the `get_logoff_scripts` function would return a list of three logoff scripts: 'script1.bat', 'script2.bat', and 'script3.bat'.
***
### FunctionDef get_startup_scripts(self)
 **get\_startup\_scripts**: This function is used to retrieve the list of startup scripts.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function returns the value of the `__startup_scripts` attribute of the object. This attribute is expected to be a list of scripts that should be executed at startup. The function does not contain any logic for modifying the list or executing the scripts. It is simply used to retrieve the list of startup scripts.

This function is called by the `add_script` function in the `add_script` module. The `add_script` function uses `get_startup_scripts` to get the list of startup scripts and then appends the script passed to it as a parameter to this list. This allows scripts to be added to the list of startup scripts.

**Note**: It is important to note that this function does not add scripts to the list of startup scripts. It only retrieves the list. To add scripts to the list, use the `add_script` function.

**Output Example**:

Assuming the `__startup_scripts` attribute of the object is initialized as follows:
```python
self.__startup_scripts = ['script1.bat', 'script2.bat']
```
A call to `get_startup_scripts` would return:
```python
['script1.bat', 'script2.bat']
```
This indicates that the scripts `script1.bat` and `script2.bat` are currently set as startup scripts.
***
### FunctionDef get_shutdown_scripts(self)
 **get\_shutdown\_scripts**: This function is used to retrieve the list of shutdown scripts.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function returns the value of the private attribute `__shutdown_scripts` which is a list containing all the shutdown scripts added using the `add_script` function. This function does not perform any filtering or validation, it simply returns the current list of shutdown scripts.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**: This function is called by the `add_script` function in the `gpoa/gpt/scriptsini.py/Scripts_lists/add_script` module. When the `action` parameter of the `add_script` function is 'SHUTDOWN', the script is added to the list of shutdown scripts using this function.

**Note**: The `get_shutdown_scripts` function is a simple getter method, it does not perform any operation other than returning the current list of shutdown scripts. It is important to note that this function does not return a copy of the list, but the actual list object. Therefore, any modification made to this list will affect the original list of shutdown scripts.

**Output Example**:
```python
['script1.bat', 'script2.bat', 'script3.bat']
```
This is an example of the output of the `get_shutdown_scripts` function, it returns a list of shutdown scripts, in this case, three scripts named 'script1.bat', 'script2.bat' and 'script3.bat'.
***
### FunctionDef add_script(self, action, script)
 **add\_script**: The function of add\_script is to add a script to the appropriate list based on the specified action.

**parameters**:
· action: A string representing the action for which the script is being added. The possible values are 'LOGON', 'LOGOFF', 'STARTUP', and 'SHUTDOWN'.
· script: A Script object representing the script to be added.

**Code Description**:
The add\_script function first checks the value of the action parameter. If the action is 'LOGON', it appends the script to the logon scripts list by calling the get\_logon\_scripts() method. If the action is 'LOGOFF', it appends the script to the logoff scripts list by calling the get\_logoff\_scripts() method. If the action is 'STARTUP', it appends the script to the startup scripts list by calling the get\_startup\_scripts() method. If the action is 'SHUTDOWN', it appends the script to the shutdown scripts list by calling the get\_shutdown\_scripts() method.

The get\_logon\_scripts(), get\_logoff\_scripts(), get\_startup\_scripts(), and get\_shutdown\_scripts() methods all return a list of scripts that have been added for the corresponding action. These methods are defined in the same Scripts\_lists class as the add\_script method.

The add\_script method is called by the read\_scripts function in the gpoa/gpt/scriptsini.py/read\_scripts module. The read\_scripts function reads a script file and adds the scripts to the appropriate lists based on the action specified in the file.

The add\_script method is an instance method, meaning it can only be called on an instance of the Scripts\_lists class. It modifies the state of the object by adding the script to the appropriate list.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the add\_script method does not return any value. Instead, it modifies the state of the object by adding the script to the appropriate list.

When calling the add\_script method, it is important to ensure that the action parameter is one of the valid values ('LOGON', 'LOGOFF', 'STARTUP', or 'SHUTDOWN'). Passing an invalid value will result in an error.

It is also important to note that the add\_script method does not validate the script parameter. It is assumed that the script parameter is a valid Script object. If an invalid object is passed, it may result in unexpected behavior.

The add\_script method is a crucial part of the project as it allows scripts to be added to the appropriate lists based on the action. This is important for managing and executing scripts based on the action.

The following is an example of how the add\_script method may be called:
```python
scripts = Scripts_lists()
script = Script('LOGON', '/path/to/script', 'parameters')
scripts.add_script('LOGON', script)
```
In this example, a new instance of the Scripts\_lists class is created. A new Script object is also created, representing a script that should be added to the logon scripts list. The add\_script method is then called with the 'LOGON' action and the script object as parameters. This will add the script to the logon scripts list.
***
## ClassDef Script
 **Script**: The Script class is a blueprint for creating script objects, which are used to manage and execute different types of scripts based on specific actions such as logon, logoff, startup, and shutdown.

**attributes**: The Script class has the following attributes:

· `action`: A string representing the action associated with the script (e.g., 'LOGON', 'LOGOFF', 'STARTUP', 'SHUTDOWN').

· `path`: A string representing the file path of the script.

· `args`: An optional argument that can be used to pass command-line arguments to the script.

· `number`: An integer representing the sequence number of the script for a given action.

**Code Description**: The Script class initializes the action, path, and number attributes in the constructor. The action attribute is set to the uppercase value of the input action parameter. The path attribute is constructed by joining the script directory, the action uppercase value, and the script filename (in uppercase) using the `os.path.join()` method. If the script file does not exist, the constructor returns `None`. The number attribute is set based on the action type (logon, logoff, startup, or shutdown) and increments the corresponding counter.

The `set_args()` method is used to set the `args` attribute of the Script object.

The Script class is used in the `read_scripts()` function to create script objects based on the input scripts file. The function reads the scripts file using a ConfigParser object and iterates through the sections and keys to create script objects based on the action type and script filename. The script objects are then added to the corresponding action dictionary (logon, logoff, startup, or shutdown) based on their action type.

**Note**: It is important to note that the `set_args()` method should be called after creating a Script object to set the `args` attribute. Additionally, the script file path should be a valid path to ensure that the script object is initialized correctly.

**Output Example**: Here is an example of how the Script class can be used to create script objects:
```python
# Create a Script object for a logon script
logon_script = Script('logon', '/path/to/script/directory', 'script.bat')

# Set the command-line arguments for the logon script
logon_script.set_args(['/arg1', '/arg2'])

# Create script objects for logoff, startup, and shutdown scripts
logoff_script = Script('logoff', '/path/to/script/directory', 'script.bat')
startup_script = Script('startup', '/path/to/script/directory', 'script.bat')
shutdown_script = Script('shutdown', '/path/to/script/directory', 'script.bat')
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, action, script_dir, script_filename)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Script object with the given parameters and set up necessary attributes.

**parameters**
· action: A string representing the action to be taken by the Script object. It can be 'LOGON', 'LOGOFF', 'STARTUP', or 'SHUTDOWN'.
· script_dir: A string representing the directory path where the script file is located.
· script_filename: A string representing the name of the script file.

**Code Description**
The __init__ function starts by converting the action parameter to uppercase and storing it in the action attribute of the object. Then, it constructs the path to the script file by joining the script_dir, action_upper, and script_filename_upper using the os.path.join() function.

Next, it checks if the constructed path is a valid file using os.path.isfile(). If the file does not exist, the function returns None.

After that, it initializes the args attribute to None.

Then, it checks the value of action_upper and sets the number attribute accordingly. If the action is 'LOGON', it sets the number attribute to the value of Script.__logon_counter and increments Script.__logon_counter by 1. It does the same for 'LOGOFF', 'STARTUP', and 'SHUTDOWN' actions.

**Note**
The Script class must have the following class attributes defined:
· Script.__logon_counter: An integer representing the number of logon scripts.
· Script.__logoff_counter: An integer representing the number of logoff scripts.
· Script.__startup_counter: An integer representing the number of startup scripts.
· Script.__shutdown_counter: An integer representing the number of shutdown scripts.

These attributes are used to assign unique numbers to each script of the same type.

**Output Example**
Assuming the following inputs:
action = 'logon'
script_dir = '/path/to/scripts'
script_filename = 'my_script.py'

The output of the __init__ function would be:

Script object with the following attributes:
· action = 'LOGON'
· path = '/path/to/scripts/LOGON/MY_SCRIPT.PY'
· args = None
· number = 0 (assuming Script.__logon_counter was 0 before the initialization)

If the file at '/path/to/scripts/LOGON/MY_SCRIPT.PY' does not exist, the output would be None.
***
### FunctionDef set_args(self, args)
 **set\_args**: The function of set\_args is to set the arguments of a Script object.

**parameters**:
· args: The arguments to be set for the Script object.

***
