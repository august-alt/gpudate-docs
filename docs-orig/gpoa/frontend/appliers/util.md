## ClassDef WallpaperStretchMode
 **WallpaperStretchMode**: The WallpaperStretchMode class is an enumeration type that defines how a wallpaper image can be stretched to fit the screen size in the desktop wallpaper application.

**Attributes**:

- `STRETCH`: An enumeration value that represents stretching the wallpaper image to fill the entire screen while maintaining its aspect ratio.

**Code Description**:

The WallpaperStretchMode class is defined as a subclass of the Enum class, which is a built-in Python class that implements enumeration types. The class has only one enumeration value, `STRETCH`, which is assigned an integer value of 2.

The `STRETCH` enumeration value represents the stretching mode where the wallpaper image is scaled up or down to fit the screen size while maintaining its aspect ratio. This means that the image will not be distorted, but it may leave some empty spaces on the screen if the aspect ratio of the image does not match the screen size.

**Note**:

- The `STRETCH` enumeration value is assigned an integer value of 2, which is arbitrary and has no special meaning. The integer value is used only to provide a unique identifier for each enumeration value.
- The WallpaperStretchMode class can be used in the desktop wallpaper application to provide a user interface for selecting the wallpaper stretching mode. The class can be used in conjunction with other enumeration values to provide more stretching options, such as filling the screen without maintaining the aspect ratio or centering the image without scaling it.
- When using the WallpaperStretchMode class, it is important to handle the enumeration values correctly and ensure that they are mapped to the appropriate stretching modes in the application. It is also recommended to provide clear and concise descriptions of each stretching mode to help users make informed decisions.
