## ClassDef RPMTestCase
 **RPMTestCase**: The function of RPMTestCase is to serve as a test case for RPM-related operations, such as installing and removing RPM packages.

**Attributes**: This class does not have any specific attributes. However, it inherits some attributes from the unittest.TestCase class, such as `assert*()` methods for asserting conditions during tests.

**Code Description**:

The RPMTestCase class is a subclass of unittest.TestCase, which is a basic unit testing utility in Python. This class provides two methods, `test_install_rpm()` and `test_remove_rpm()`, both of which are skipped due to the `@unittest.skip()` decorators. These methods are intended to test the installation and removal of RPM packages, respectively.

In the `test_install_rpm()` method, a list of test package names (tortoisehg and csync) is defined. The `install_rpms()` function is then called with this list as an argument to install the packages.

Similarly, in the `test_remove_rpm()` method, the same list of test package names is used, and the `remove_rpms()` function is called to remove the packages.

**Note**:

1. The `@unittest.skip()` decorators are used to temporarily exclude these test methods from execution. In order to run these tests, you need to remove or comment out the decorators.
2. Ensure that the `install_rpms()` and `remove_rpms()` functions are properly implemented and accessible in the test environment.
3. The test_package\_names list contains string values. Make sure these package names are valid and correspond to the actual RPM packages you intend to test.
4. The unittest module provides a way to organize and automate testing of Python code. It supports a rich set of assertions and fixtures to help create comprehensive tests.
5. To run the tests, you can use the unittest.TextTestRunner class or any other test runner compatible with the unittest framework.
### FunctionDef test_install_rpm(self)
 **test\_install\_rpm**: The function of `test_install_rpm` is to test the installation of a set of RPM packages using the `install_rpms` function from the `gpoa/util/rpm.py` module.

**parameters**:
· There are no parameters for this function.

**Code Description**:
The `test_install_rpm` function is defined in the `gpoa/test/util/test_rpm.py` module and does not take any parameters. It creates a list of RPM package names `test_package_names` and passes it to the `install_rpms` function to install the packages.

The `install_rpms` function is defined in the `gpoa/util/rpm.py` module and takes a list of RPM package names as a parameter. It iterates through each package name in the list and calls the `install_rpm` function for each package name. The `install_rpm` function creates a `Package` object with the given package name and calls the `install()` method of that object to install the package.

The `Package` class is defined in the `gpoa/util/rpm.py` module and provides methods to manage the installation, reinstallation, and removal of RPM packages using the yum package manager. The `Package` class is initialized with a `package_name`, which can optionally end with a '-' character to indicate that the package should be marked for removal instead of installation. The `installed` attribute is initialized by checking if the package is currently installed using the `is_rpm_installed` function (not shown in the provided code).

The `Package` class provides several methods to manage the package:

· `mark_for_install()`: Sets the `for_install` attribute to `True`, indicating that the package should be installed.

· `mark_for_removal()`: Sets the `for_install` attribute to `False`, indicating that the package should be removed.

· `is_installed()`: Returns the `installed` attribute.

· `is_for_install()`: Returns the `for_install` attribute.

· `is_for_removal()`: Returns the negation of the `for_install` attribute.

· `action()`: Performs the appropriate action based on the `for_install` attribute. If the package is marked for installation and is not currently installed, the `install()` method is called. If the package is marked for removal and is currently installed, the `remove()` method is called.

· `install()`: Installs the package using the yum install command.

The `test_install_rpm` function is called by the `unittest` framework to test the installation of a set of RPM packages.

**Note**:

· The `Package` class assumes that the system has the yum package manager installed and that the package names are valid RPM package names.

· The `Package` class does not handle errors that may occur during the installation, reinstallation, or removal of packages.

· The `Package` class does not provide a method to update packages.

· The `test_install_rpm` function does not test for errors or edge cases during the installation of packages. It is a basic test to ensure that the `install_rpms` function is working as expected.

### FunctionDef test_remove_rpm(self)
 **test\_remove\_rpm**: The function of test\_remove\_rpm is to test the removal of a set of RPM packages using the remove\_rpms function.

**parameters**: The test\_remove\_rpm function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The test\_remove\_rpm function is a method of the RPMTestCase class, which is used for testing the functionality of the remove\_rpms function. It is defined in the test\_rpm.py module, which is a part of the testing package of the project.

Inside the test\_remove\_rpm function, a list of RPM package names, test\_package\_names, is defined, which contains two package names 'tortoisehg' and 'csync'. The remove\_rpms function is then called with the test\_package\_names list as an argument.

The remove\_rpms function is defined in the rpm.py module and is responsible for removing a set of RPM packages sequentially from the system by calling the remove\_rpm function for each package name in the input list.

The test\_remove\_rpm function does not return any value. Instead, it uses the unittest framework's assert methods to check if the packages have been removed successfully.

It is important to note that the remove\_rpms function assumes that the system has the apt package manager installed and that the package names are valid Debian package names. Additionally, the remove\_rpms function does not handle errors that may occur during the removal of packages. Therefore, it is recommended to call the remove\_rpms function only after checking that the packages are installed, to avoid errors.

**Note**:

* The test\_remove\_rpm function is a test case for the remove\_rpms function and is used to verify its functionality.
* The test\_remove\_rpm function does not take any parameters.
* It is recommended to call the remove\_rpms function only after checking that the packages are installed, to avoid errors.
* The remove\_rpms function assumes that the system has the apt package manager installed and that the package names are valid Debian package names.
* The remove\_rpms function does not handle errors that may occur during the removal of packages.
