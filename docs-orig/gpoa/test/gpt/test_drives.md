## ClassDef GptDrivesTestCase
 **GptDrivesTestCase**: The function of GptDrivesTestCase is to test the functionality of reading objects from Shortcuts.xml using the `test_drive_reader` method.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are inherited from the `unittest.TestCase` class and do not have any additional parameters.

**Code Description**:

The `GptDrivesTestCase` class is a subclass of `unittest.TestCase` and is used to test the functionality of the `gpt.drives.read_drives` method. The `test_drive_reader` method is a test method that uses the `unittest.mock.patch` decorator to mock the `cache_dir` function from the `util.paths` module. This is done to isolate the test and ensure that it does not depend on external resources.

In the `test_drive_reader` method, the `cdir_mock.return_value` is set to `'/var/cache/gpupdate'` to specify the cache directory path for the test. The `gpt.drives.read_drives` method is then called with the path to the test data file as an argument.

The `read_drives` method returns a list of drive objects, which are then converted to JSON format using the `to_json` method. The JSON object is then checked to ensure that it is not `None` and that the `drive` key is present.

**Note**:

* The `unittest.mock.patch` decorator is used to mock the `cache_dir` function from the `util.paths` module. This is done to ensure that the test does not depend on external resources and to make the test more reliable.
* The `to_json` method is used to convert the drive object to JSON format. This is done to check the contents of the object and ensure that it is correctly populated.

**Output Example**:

The output of the `test_drive_reader` method would be a `None` assertion error if the `drive` key is not present in the JSON object. If the `drive` key is present, the test would pass.
### FunctionDef test_drive_reader(self, cdir_mock)
 **test\_drive\_reader**: The function of test\_drive\_reader is to test the functionality of reading objects from Shortcuts.xml using the read\_drives function.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are:
Â· cdir\_mock: A mock object that returns a specified directory path when called.

**Code Description**:
The test\_drive\_reader function begins by setting the return value of the cdir\_mock object to '/var/cache/gpupdate'. It then imports the gpt.drives module and sets the path of the test data file (Drives.xml) using the os.getcwd() function to get the current working directory.

Next, it calls the read\_drives function with the test data file path as an argument and assigns the returned list of drivemap objects to the variable drvs.

After that, it converts the first drive object in the drvs list to a JSON formatted string using the to\_json function and parses it into a Python dictionary using the json.loads() function.

Finally, it asserts that the 'drive' key of the parsed JSON object is not None, which tests whether the drive object contains the necessary drive information.

**Relation with Callees**:
The test\_drive\_reader function calls the read\_drives function to read the drive information from the test data file and converts the returned drive object to a JSON formatted string using the to\_json function.

**Note**:
The test\_drive\_reader function is a test function that tests the functionality of reading objects from Shortcuts.xml using the read\_drives function. It uses a mock object to set the directory path for testing purposes.

**Output Example**:
A possible output of the test\_drive\_reader function when the test data file contains valid drive information would be:
```python
None
```
This indicates that the assertion passed and the drive object contains the necessary drive information.
