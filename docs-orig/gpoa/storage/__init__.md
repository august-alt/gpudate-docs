## FunctionDef cache_factory(cache_name)
 **cache\_factory**: The function of cache\_factory is to create and return a cache object based on a specified cache name.

**parameters**:
· cache\_name: A string identifier that specifies the type of cache to be created.

**Code Description**:
The cache\_factory function takes a cache\_name as a parameter and returns an instance of a cache implementation based on the specified cache\_name. In this case, if the cache\_name corresponds to an SQLite database, the function returns an instance of the sqlite\_cache class.

The cache\_factory function is used in the samba\_backend class in the gpoa/backend/samba\_backend.py module to create cache objects for storing and retrieving data. By using the cache\_factory function, the samba\_backend class can create cache objects without having to know the specific implementation details of each cache type. This allows the samba\_backend class to be more flexible and reusable, as it can work with any cache implementation that is compatible with the cache\_factory function.

The cache\_factory function is also used in the __init__ method of the samba\_backend class to create a regpol\_cache object and a gpo\_names object for storing and retrieving registry policy data and GPO names, respectively.

It is important to note that the cache\_factory function is not responsible for creating the cache objects themselves. Instead, it is responsible for creating and returning instances of cache implementation classes based on the specified cache\_name. The actual creation and management of the cache objects is handled by the cache implementation classes themselves.

**Note**:

- The cache\_factory function is a simple factory function that creates and returns instances of cache implementation classes based on a specified cache\_name.
- The cache\_factory function is used in the samba\_backend class to create cache objects for storing and retrieving data.
- The cache\_factory function is not responsible for creating the cache objects themselves. Instead, it is responsible for creating and returning instances of cache implementation classes based on the specified cache\_name.

**Output Example**:

Here is an example of how the cache\_factory function can be used:

```python
from gpoa.storage.cache_factory import cache_factory

# Create a sqlite_cache object with the name 'my_cache'
cache = cache_factory('my_cache')

# Use the cache object to store and retrieve data
cache.store('key1', 'value1')
cache.store('key2', 'value2')

value1 = cache.get('key1')  # returns 'value1'
value2 = cache.get('key2')  # returns 'value2'
value3 = cache.get('key3')  # returns None

default_value = cache.get_default('key3', 'default_value')  # returns 'default_value'
```

In this example, the cache\_factory function is used to create a sqlite\_cache object with the name 'my\_cache'. The cache object is then used to store and retrieve data using the store and get methods, respectively. If a value is not found in the cache, the get\_default method is used to retrieve a default value.
## FunctionDef registry_factory(registry_name, registry_dir)
 **registry\_factory**: The function of registry\_factory is to create and manage a registry storage object.

**parameters**:
· name: The name of the registry storage object to be created. It can be 'registry' or 'registry\_hive'.
· reg\_path: The path of the registry hive file to be loaded. It is optional and only used when name is 'registry\_hive'.

**Code Description**:
registry\_factory is a function that creates and manages a registry storage object. It first checks the name of the registry storage object to be created. If the name is 'registry', it creates a SQLAlchemy session and queries the database to get the necessary information about the domain, machine name, and machine SID. If the name is 'registry\_hive', it loads the specified registry hive file and creates a registry storage object that can read and write to the hive file.

The registry storage object provides methods to add, delete, and query registry keys and values in the hive file. It also provides methods to get and set the domain, machine name, and machine SID information.

The registry\_factory function is used by other parts of the code to create registry storage objects and perform registry operations. It ensures that the registry storage objects are created and managed consistently throughout the code.

**Note**:
None.

**Output Example**:
registry\_factory('registry')
registry\_factory('registry\_hive', '/path/to/hive/file')
