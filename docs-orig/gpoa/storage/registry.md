## ClassDef registry
 **registry**: The `registry` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that serves as a base for storing and managing registry data in a SQLite database. It is designed to be subclassed and does not provide a functional registry on its own.

**attributes**:
· `db_name`: A string representing the name of the SQLite database file.

**Code Description**:
The `registry` class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for a registry implementation using a SQLite database. It initializes the database connection and sets up the necessary tables and mappers for storing registry data. The class also provides methods for adding, updating, and deleting registry entries, as well as for querying and retrieving entries based on a specific SID (Security Identifier).

The `registry` class is not intended to be used directly and is instead meant to be subclassed by concrete implementations of a registry, such as the `sqlite_registry` class. The `sqlite_registry` class provides a concrete implementation of the `registry` class and adds additional functionality specific to SQLite databases.

The `registry` class uses the SQLAlchemy library for database access and provides a convenient and flexible interface for working with registry data in a SQLite database. The class uses SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapper) functionality to map Python objects to database tables and provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with registry data.

The `registry` class also provides a number of methods for querying and retrieving registry data based on a specific SID. These methods allow for easy filtering and retrieval of registry data based on the SID of the user or machine associated with the data.

**Note**:

* The `registry` class is an abstract base class and is not intended to be used directly. Instead, it should be subclassed by concrete implementations of a registry, such as the `sqlite_registry` class.
* The `registry` class uses the SQLAlchemy library for database access and requires a working installation of SQLAlchemy to function properly.
* The `registry` class is designed to work with SQLite databases and may not be compatible with other types of databases.
* The `registry` class provides a convenient and flexible interface for working with registry data in a SQLite database, but it is important to use the class correctly and to follow best practices for working with databases to ensure data integrity and consistency.

In the project, the `registry` class is used as a base class for the `sqlite_registry` class, which provides a concrete implementation of a registry using a SQLite database. The `sqlite_registry` class subclasses the `registry` class and adds additional functionality specific to SQLite databases, such as support for SQLite-specific database features and SQLite-specific querying and retrieval methods. The `sqlite_registry` class is used throughout the project to store and manage registry data in a SQLite database.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the registry object with a given database name.

**parameters**:
· db\_name: (str) The name of the database that the registry object will be associated with.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a special method in Python classes, called when an object is initialized. In this case, it is defined within the registry class, and is used to set up the initial state of the registry object.

The single parameter, db\_name, is a string representing the name of the database the registry object will be associated with. This parameter is required when creating a new registry object.

Currently, the function does not contain any implementation. Typically, this function would contain code to initialize the internal state of the registry object, using the provided db\_name.

**Note**:
- The db\_name parameter is expected to be a string, and it should not be None or an empty string.
- Proper validation and error handling should be implemented within the __init__ function to ensure the db\_name is valid and usable.
- The __init__ function should also initialize any other necessary attributes or properties for the registry object to function correctly.
