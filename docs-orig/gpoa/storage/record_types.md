## ClassDef samba_preg
 **samba\_preg**: The function of samba\_preg is to represent an object mapping for HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) entry in the Windows registry. It holds the properties of a registry key without the SID (Security Identifier).

**attributes**:
· **policy\_name**: A string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.
· **keyname**: A string that holds the name of the registry key.
· **valuename**: A string that holds the name of the value associated with the registry key.
· **hive\_key**: A string that holds the full path of the registry key in the format of `{keyname}\{valuename}`.
· **type**: An integer that holds the type of the value (e.g., REG\_SZ, REG\_DWORD, etc.).
· **data**: A string that holds the data associated with the value.

**Code Description**:
The samba\_preg class is defined as a subclass of the built-in object class. It has an initializer method that takes two parameters, preg\_obj and policy\_name. preg\_obj is an object that contains the properties of a registry key, and policy\_name is a string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.

The initializer method assigns the properties of preg\_obj and policy\_name to the respective attributes of the samba\_preg object. It also creates the hive\_key attribute by concatenating the keyname and valuename attributes.

The update\_fields method returns a dictionary of the attributes that can be updated in the database. These attributes are policy\_name, type, and data.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The samba\_preg class is used in the sqlite\_registry class to map the HKLM table in the SQLite database. The sqlite\_registry class uses the samba\_preg class to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the HKLM table.

The samba\_preg class is used in the add\_hklm\_entry method of the sqlite\_registry class to insert a new entry into the HKLM table. The method takes two parameters, preg\_entry and policy\_name. preg\_entry is an object that contains the properties of a registry key, and policy\_name is a string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.

The samba\_preg class is also used in the _hklm\_upsert method of the sqlite\_registry class to update an existing entry in the HKLM table. The method takes a row parameter, which is an instance of the samba\_preg class.

**Note**:
The samba\_preg class is an internal class of the sqlite\_registry class and should not be used outside of it.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how to use the samba\_preg class in the add\_hklm\_entry method of the sqlite\_registry class:

```python
preg_obj = {'keyname': 'Software', 'valuename': 'Microsoft', 'type': 1, 'data': 'Windows'}
policy_name = 'MyPolicy'

registry = sqlite_registry('my_database')
registry.add_hklm_entry(preg_obj, policy_name)
```

In this example, a new entry is inserted into the HKLM table with the keyname "Software", valuename "Microsoft", type REG\_SZ, and data "Windows". The policy name associated with the entry is "MyPolicy".
### FunctionDef __init__(self, preg_obj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the samba\_preg object with the given parameters.

**parameters**:
· `preg_obj`: An object containing the necessary information for initializing the samba\_preg object, such as `keyname`, `valuename`, `type`, and `data`.
· `policy_name`: A string representing the name of the policy.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` function initializes the samba\_preg object by setting the `policy_name` attribute to the given `policy_name` parameter. It then sets the `keyname`, `valuename`, `type`, and `data` attributes by accessing the corresponding attributes of the `preg_obj` parameter.

The `hive_key` attribute is then created by concatenating the `keyname` and `valuename` attributes with a backslash in between.

**Note**:
- The `preg_obj` parameter is expected to have the attributes `keyname`, `valuename`, `type`, and `data`. If it does not have any of these attributes, an `AttributeError` may be raised.
- The `policy_name` parameter is expected to be a string. If it is not a string, a `TypeError` may be raised.
- The `hive_key` attribute is a string that represents the key in the registry where the policy data is stored. It is created by concatenating the `keyname` and `valuename` attributes with a backslash in between.
- The `type` and `data` attributes are determined by the `preg_obj` parameter and are not modified in the `__init__` function.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create a dictionary of fields with values from the object's properties.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The update\_fields function initializes a new dictionary called fields. It then adds three key-value pairs to the dictionary, where the keys are 'policy\_name', 'type', and 'data', and the values are the corresponding properties of the object. These properties are: self.policy\_name, self.type, and self.data. The function then returns the created dictionary.

From a functional perspective, this function is used to prepare a set of fields to be updated in a database. The fields and their values are extracted from an object and returned as a dictionary, which can then be passed to a database query to update the corresponding fields in a record.

The update\_fields function is called by the _hklm\_upsert function in the sqlite\_registry module. The _hklm\_upsert function uses the returned dictionary to update a record in the database. If adding a new record fails due to a unique constraint violation, the function retrieves the existing record and updates it with the new values.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the object properties used in the update\_fields function are correctly set before calling the function. If any of the properties are None or have not been initialized, the resulting dictionary will contain missing or incorrect values.

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    'policy_name': 'example_policy',
    'type': 'example_type',
    'data': 'example_data'
}
```
***
## ClassDef samba_hkcu_preg
 **samba_hkcu_preg**: The function of samba_hkcu_preg is to represent an object mapping for HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) entries in the Windows registry, which are key-value pairs with a Security Identifier (SID).

**attributes**:
· `sid`: A string representing the SID of the user associated with the HKCU entry.
· `policy_name`: A string specifying the name of the policy applied to the HKCU entry.
· `keyname`: A string representing the name of the registry key.
· `valuename`: A string representing the name of the registry value.
· `hive_key`: A string formed by concatenating `keyname` and `valuename` with a backslash, representing the full path of the registry key-value pair.
· `type`: An integer representing the data type of the registry value.
· `data`: A string representing the data stored in the registry value.

**Code Description**:
The samba_hkcu_preg class is defined with an initializer method that takes `sid`, `preg_obj`, and `policy_name` as parameters. The `preg_obj` parameter is an instance of the `Preg` class from the `samba.net` package, which contains the registry key-value pair information. The initializer method extracts the necessary information from `preg_obj` and assigns it to the class attributes.

The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary containing the `policy_name`, `type`, and `data` attributes of the class. This method is used when updating the database with new or modified HKCU entries.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The samba_hkcu_preg class is primarily used in the `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py` module, where it is mapped to the `HKCU` table in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) functionality. The `_hkcu_upsert`, `_delete_hkcu_keyname`, `add_hkcu_entry`, `get_hkcu_entry`, `filter_hkcu_entries`, and `wipe_user` functions in the `sqlite_registry` class interact with the samba_hkcu_preg class to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the HKCU entries in the SQLite database.

**Note**:
When using the samba_hkcu_preg class, ensure that the `sid`, `keyname`, and `valuename` attributes are correctly set according to the target HKCU entry in the Windows registry. Additionally, the `policy_name` attribute should be set to the appropriate policy name for the entry.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value:

```python
hkcu_entry = samba_hkcu_preg('S-1-5-21-123456789-0123456789-123456789-12345', preg_obj, 'MyPolicy')
print(hkcu_entry.hive_key)  # Output: HKCU\MyValue
print(hkcu_entry.type)  # Output: 1 (REG_SZ)
print(hkcu_entry.data)  # Output: 'Hello, World!'
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, preg_obj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the samba\_hkcu\_preg object with the necessary parameters.

**parameters**:
· sid: The SID (Security Identifier) for which the policy is being set.
· preg\_obj: An object of the preg class, which contains the keyname, valuename, type, and data necessary for creating the hive\_key.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy being set.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the samba\_hkcu\_preg object by setting the values of its attributes. The `self.sid` attribute is set to the provided sid parameter. The `self.policy_name` attribute is set to the provided policy\_name parameter. The `self.keyname` and `self.valuename` attributes are set to the keyname and valuename attributes of the preg\_obj parameter, respectively. The `self.hive_key` attribute is then set to the concatenation of `self.keyname` and `self.valuename`, with a backslash (\) as a separator. The `self.type` and `self.data` attributes are set to the type and data attributes of the preg\_obj parameter, respectively.

**Note**:
- The `preg_obj` parameter should be an object of the `preg` class, with the attributes `keyname`, `valuename`, `type`, and `data`.
- The `sid` and `policy_name` parameters should be strings.
- The `hive_key` attribute is a combination of `keyname` and `valuename` and is used to access the registry key in windows.
- The `type` attribute is the type of the registry value, and the `data` attribute is the value of the registry key.
- The `self.hive_key` is a formatted string which is used to access the registry key in windows.
- The `self.type` and `self.data` are used to set the value of the registry key in windows.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create and return a dictionary containing the policy name, type, and data.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The update\_fields function first initializes an empty dictionary called fields. It then assigns the values of the policy\_name, type, and data attributes of the object that calls this function to the keys 'policy\_name', 'type', and 'data' of the fields dictionary, respectively. Finally, the function returns the fields dictionary.

This function is used to prepare the data to be updated in the database. It is called by the _hkcu\_upsert function in the sqlite\_registry module, which updates the corresponding record in the database with the data returned by the update\_fields function.

**Note**: It is important to note that this function assumes that the object that calls it has the attributes 'policy\_name', 'type', and 'data'. If these attributes do not exist, the function will raise an AttributeError.

**Output Example**:
```python
{'policy_name': 'example_policy', 'type': 'example_type', 'data': 'example_data'}
```
***
## ClassDef ad_shortcut
 **ad\_shortcut**: The function of ad\_shortcut is to represent Windows shortcut objects in a mapping format.

**attributes**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the shortcut's owner.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the shortcut.
· path: The path of the shortcut.
· shortcut: A JSON representation of the shortcut.

**Code Description**:
The ad\_shortcut class is a mapping representation of a Windows shortcut object. It has four attributes: sid, policy\_name, path, and shortcut. The sid attribute is a unique identifier for the shortcut's owner, policy\_name is the name of the policy associated with the shortcut, path is the path of the shortcut, and shortcut is a JSON representation of the shortcut.

The class has two methods:

1. **\_\_init\_\_**: This is the constructor method that initializes the attributes of the class. It takes three parameters: sid, sc, and policy\_name. The sid parameter is the unique identifier for the shortcut's owner, sc is an object of the Shortcut class, and policy\_name is the name of the policy associated with the shortcut.
2. **update\_fields**: This method returns a dictionary of the class's attributes. It is used in the sqlite\_registry module to update the shortcut information in the database.

The ad\_shortcut class is used in the sqlite\_registry module to store and retrieve shortcut information in the database. The sqlite\_registry module creates a table for the shortcuts and maps the ad\_shortcut class to the table using the mapper\_reg object. The add\_shortcut method in the sqlite\_registry module uses the ad\_shortcut class to store shortcut information in the database. The get\_shortcuts method in the sqlite\_registry module uses the ad\_shortcut class to retrieve shortcut information from the database.

**Note**:
The ad\_shortcut class is not meant to be used independently. It is used in the sqlite\_registry module to store and retrieve shortcut information in the database.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of how the ad\_shortcut class is used in the sqlite\_registry module to store shortcut information in the database:
```python
sid = '12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab'
sc = Shortcut('C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\shortcut.lnk')
policy_name = 'My Policy'

registry = sqlite_registry('my_registry')
registry.add_shortcut(sid, sc, policy_name)
```
In this example, the add\_shortcut method in the sqlite\_registry module is used to store shortcut information in the database using the ad\_shortcut class. The sid parameter is a unique identifier for the shortcut's owner, sc is an object of the Shortcut class representing the shortcut, and policy\_name is the name of the policy associated with the shortcut.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, sc, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ad\_shortcut object with the necessary attributes.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the shortcut.
· sc: An object of a class that has the attributes 'dest' and 'to\_json()' method.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the shortcut.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ad\_shortcut object by setting the 'sid' attribute to the provided sid, 'policy\_name' attribute to the provided policy\_name, and 'path' attribute to the 'dest' attribute of the provided sc object. It also calls the 'to\_json()' method of the sc object and sets the result to the 'shortcut' attribute.

**Note**:
- The provided sc object should have the attributes 'dest' and 'to\_json()' method, otherwise, it will raise an error.
- The 'sid' and 'policy\_name' should be of string type, while the sc object can be of any type that fulfills the above-mentioned conditions.
- The 'path' attribute will be assigned the value of the 'dest' attribute of the sc object, and the 'shortcut' attribute will be assigned the json representation of the sc object.
- This function is used to create an instance of the ad\_shortcut class, and it is called automatically when an instance is created.
- It is a good practice to initialize all the necessary attributes in the __init__ function to ensure that the object is in a consistent state when it is created.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create and return a dictionary containing the policy\_name, path, and shortcut attributes of an ad\_shortcut object.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function first initializes an empty dictionary called fields (line 2). It then adds three key-value pairs to the dictionary. The keys are 'policy\_name', 'path', and 'shortcut' and the values are the corresponding attribute values of the ad\_shortcut object that calls this function (lines 3-5). Finally, the function returns the populated dictionary (line 6).

This function is used to prepare the data for updating a record in the database. By returning a dictionary, it allows for dynamic updates of the database record without specifying the column names explicitly.

From a functional perspective, this function plays a crucial role in the _shortcut\_upsert function in the sqlite\_registry module. Specifically, it is used to update the existing record in the database when an attempt to add a new record fails due to a unique constraint violation (lines 4-5 in the _shortcut\_upsert function).

**Note**:
It is important to note that this function does not modify the state of the ad\_shortcut object that calls it. Instead, it creates a new dictionary object that contains the relevant attribute values.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of the output of the update\_fields function:
```python
{'policy_name': 'example_policy', 'path': '/example/path', 'shortcut': True}
```
This output can then be used to update the corresponding record in the database.
***
## ClassDef info_entry
 **info\_entry**: The function of info\_entry is to represent a piece of information with a name and a value.

**attributes**:
· name: A string that serves as the unique identifier for this information.
· value: The content of this information, which can be any Python object.

**Code Description**:
The `info_entry` class has two methods: `__init__` and `update_fields`. The `__init__` method initializes the object with a given name and value, and `update_fields` returns a dictionary containing the current value of the object.

The `info_entry` class is used in the `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py` module to store information in a SQLite database. Specifically, it is used to store global policy settings for a system. The `set_info` and `get_info` methods in the `sqlite_registry` class handle the insertion and retrieval of `info_entry` objects in the database.

When a new `info_entry` object is created, it is first attempted to be inserted into the database using the `_add` method in the `sqlite_registry` class. If the insertion fails (e.g., due to a unique constraint violation), the existing object with the same name is updated instead. This behavior is handled by the `_info_upsert` method in the `sqlite_registry` class.

**Note**:
When creating a new `info_entry` object, make sure the name is unique among all other `info_entry` objects in the database. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Creating a new info_entry object
ie = info_entry('background_color', 'red')

# Updating the value of the object
ie.value = 'blue'

# Retrieving the value of the object
print(ie.update_fields()['value'])  # Output: 'blue'
```
This example shows how to create a new `info_entry` object, update its value, and retrieve the updated value.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, name, value)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize an info\_entry object with a name and a value.

**parameters**:
· name: (required) A string that represents the name of the info\_entry object.
· value: (required) A value that the info\_entry object will hold. This can be any data type.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` function is a special method in Python classes, called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.

In this particular `__init__` function, two attributes are being initialized: `name` and `value`. The `name` attribute is set to the value of the `name` parameter, and the `value` attribute is set to the value of the `value` parameter.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

* `def __init__(self, name, value):` This line is defining the `__init__` function, which takes three parameters: `self`, `name`, and `value`. `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access variables and methods associated with that instance.
* `self.name = name`: This line is setting the `name` attribute of the `self` object to the value of the `name` parameter.
* `self.value = value`: This line is setting the `value` attribute of the `self` object to the value of the `value` parameter.

**Note**:
The `name` and `value` parameters are required when creating an `info_entry` object. If `name` or `value` is not provided, a `TypeError` will be raised.

Here is an example of how to use the `__init__` function to create an `info_entry` object:

```python
entry = info_entry('example_name', 'example_value')
```

In this example, an `info_entry` object named `entry` is being created with a `name` of 'example\_name' and a `value` of 'example\_value'.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create a dictionary of field-value pairs to be used for updating records in a database.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The update\_fields function first initializes an empty dictionary called fields. Then, it adds a key-value pair to the dictionary with the key 'value' and the value being the value attribute of the object that calls this function. Finally, the function returns the filled dictionary.

The purpose of this function is to prepare the data for updating records in a database. The dictionary returned by this function will be used as the input for the update() method of a SQLAlchemy query object, which will update the records in the database with the new values.

From a functional perspective, this function plays a crucial role in the _info\_upsert function in the sqlite\_registry module. The _info\_upsert function is responsible for inserting or updating records in the database. When there is an attempt to insert a record with a name that already exists in the database, the _info\_upsert function catches the resulting exception and calls the update\_fields function to prepare the data for updating the existing record.

**Note**: It is important to note that the update\_fields function is designed to be used as a method of an object that has a 'value' attribute. If this function is called on an object that does not have a 'value' attribute, it will result in a KeyError.

***
## ClassDef printer_entry
 **printer\_entry**: The `printer_entry` class is used to represent Windows printer configurations in the form of an object mapping.

**attributes**:
· `sid`: A string representing the security identifier (SID) of the user or group associated with the printer.
· `policy_name`: A string representing the name of the policy associated with the printer.
· `name`: A string representing the name of the printer.
· `printer`: A JSON string representing the printer's configuration.

**Code Description**:
The `printer_entry` class has two methods: `__init__` and `update_fields`. The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given SID, printer object, and policy name. It sets the `sid`, `policy_name`, `name`, and `printer` attributes of the object. The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary containing the current values of the `policy_name`, `name`, and `printer` attributes.

The `printer_entry` class is used in the `sqlite_registry` class to store and retrieve printer configurations from a SQLite database. When a new printer configuration is added to the database, the `add_printer` method of the `sqlite_registry` class creates a new `printer_entry` object with the given SID, printer object, and policy name. It then calls the `_printer_upsert` method to either add the new object to the database or update an existing object with the same SID and name.

The `get_printers` method of the `sqlite_registry` class returns a list of `printer_entry` objects associated with the given SID. The `wipe_user` method of the `sqlite_registry` class deletes all `printer_entry` objects associated with the given SID from the database.

**Note**:
When creating a new `printer_entry` object, make sure to pass in a valid printer object with a `name` attribute.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, pobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the printer entry object with the required parameters.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the printer entry object.
· pobj: An object of the printer class, which needs to be converted to JSON format.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the printer entry.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the printer entry object by setting the values of three attributes: sid, policy\_name, and name. The sid and policy\_name attributes are directly assigned the values of the input parameters. The name attribute is assigned the name property of the pobj parameter, which is expected to be an object of the printer class. The printer attribute is assigned the JSON representation of the pobj parameter, which is obtained by calling its to\_json() method.

**Note**:
- The pobj parameter must be an instance of the printer class, and it must have a to\_json() method that returns a JSON representation of the object.
- The sid and policy\_name parameters must be strings.
- The name attribute is derived from the pobj parameter, so any changes to the name property of the printer object after creating the printer entry object will not be reflected in the printer entry object.
- The printer attribute is a JSON representation of the printer object, so it cannot be used to access the methods or properties of the printer object directly. It can only be used to access the data attributes of the printer object.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create and return a dictionary containing the policy name, name, and printer in JSON format.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function first initializes an empty dictionary called fields (line 2). It then adds three key-value pairs to this dictionary. The keys are 'policy\_name', 'name', and 'printer' and the values are obtained from the object's 'policy\_name' attribute, 'name' attribute, and 'printer' attribute respectively (lines 3-5). The 'printer' attribute is converted to a JSON format using the 'to\_json' method before being added to the dictionary.
The function finally returns the 'fields' dictionary (line 6).

From a functional perspective, this function is used to prepare the data for updating a printer entry in the database. The returned dictionary is used as an argument for the 'update' method of the SQLAlchemy query object in the '_printer\_upsert' method of the 'sqlite\_registry' object.

**Note**:

* The function does not perform any error checking or exception handling. It assumes that the object's attributes have been properly initialized and contain valid values.
* The function returns a dictionary, which is a mutable data type. Therefore, any changes made to this dictionary after it has been returned by the function will affect the original dictionary.

***
## ClassDef drive_entry
 **drive\_entry**: The function of drive\_entry is to represent Samba share bound to drive letter as an object mapping.

**attributes**:
· sid: The security identifier (SID) of the user or group to which the drive mapping applies.
· dobj: An object containing login, password, dir, path, action, thisDrive, allDrives, label, persistent, and useLetter attributes.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy that the drive mapping belongs to.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given SID, an object containing various drive mapping attributes, and a policy name. It assigns the attributes of the given object to the corresponding attributes of the drive\_entry object.

The `update_fields` method creates a dictionary of the object's attributes for updating or inserting records in the database.

This class is used in the `sqlite_registry` class to manage drive mappings in a SQLite database. The `add_drive` method of `sqlite_registry` creates a new drive\_entry object and inserts or updates it in the database using the `_drive_upsert` method. The `get_drives` method retrieves drive mappings for a given SID from the database. The `wipe_user` method deletes drive mappings associated with a given SID from the database.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `dobj` parameter contains all necessary attributes for creating a drive\_entry object.

**Output Example**:
```python
drive_entry('S-1-1-0', 
            {'login': 'username', 'password': 'password', 'dir': 'C:\\', 'path': '\\\\server\\share', 'action': 'A', 'thisDrive': 'C', 'allDrives': 'False', 'label': 'My Share', 'persistent': 'True', 'useLetter': 'True'},
            'My Policy')
```
This creates a drive\_entry object with the specified SID, drive mapping attributes, and policy name.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, dobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the drive\_entry object with the given parameters.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the drive entry.
· dobj: An object containing drive information, such as login, password, directory, etc.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with this drive entry.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the drive\_entry object by setting its attributes with the given parameters. The sid, policy\_name, and the attributes of the dobj object (login, password, dir, path, action, thisDrive, allDrives, label, persistent, useLetter) are assigned to the corresponding attributes of the drive\_entry object. This allows the drive\_entry object to have its own copies of these attributes, which can be used and modified independently of the original dobj object.

**Note**:
- The sid and policy\_name are required parameters, while dobj is also expected to have the necessary attributes for the drive\_entry object to be properly initialized.
- The drive\_entry object is initialized with a reference to the original dobj object, allowing it to access and modify the original drive information if necessary.
- The drive\_entry object can be used to represent a drive with a specific policy name and sid, and can be used to perform actions on the drive, such as mounting or unmounting, based on the policy associated with it.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to create a dictionary of the object's attributes.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The update\_fields function is a method of the drive\_entry class, which is used to create a dictionary of the object's attributes. It initializes an empty dictionary called fields and then assigns the values of the object's attributes to the corresponding keys in the dictionary. The keys in the dictionary are policy\_name, login, password, dir, path, action, thisDrive, allDrives, label, persistent, and useLetter. These keys correspond to the attribute names of the drive\_entry object. The function then returns the dictionary containing the object's attributes.

This function is used by the _drive\_upsert function in the sqlite\_registry class to update the existing record in the database with the new values of the object's attributes. The _drive\_upsert function filters the record in the database based on the sid and dir attributes of the object and then updates the record with the new values returned by the update\_fields function.

**Note**: It is important to note that the update\_fields function is only used internally within the gpoa project and should not be called directly. Also, the function assumes that the object has the necessary attributes, and if any attribute is missing, it will result in a KeyError.

**Output Example**:
```python
{'policy_name': 'example_policy', 'login': 'user', 'password': 'pass', 'dir': '/example_dir', 'path': '/example_path', 'action': 'example_action', 'thisDrive': True, 'allDrives': False, 'label': 'example_label', 'persistent': True, 'useLetter': False}
```
***
## ClassDef folder_entry
 **folder\_entry**: The function of folder\_entry is to represent a file system directory as an object mapping.

**attributes**:
· sid: A string that represents the security identifier (SID) of the user or group associated with the directory.
· policy\_name: A string that represents the name of the policy associated with the directory.
· path: A string that represents the path of the directory.
· action: A string that represents the action to be taken on the directory.
· delete\_folder: A string that represents whether the folder should be deleted or not.
· delete\_sub\_folders: A string that represents whether the sub-folders of the folder should be deleted or not.
· delete\_files: A string that represents whether the files in the folder should be deleted or not.
· hidden\_folder: A string that represents whether the folder should be hidden or not.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes the folder\_entry object with the given SID, fobj (file object), and policy\_name. It sets the attributes of the object based on the corresponding attributes of the fobj.

The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of the fields that need to be updated for the folder\_entry object.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The folder\_entry class is used in the sqlite\_registry class to map the 'Folders' table in the SQLite database. The `add_folder` method in sqlite\_registry creates a new folder\_entry object and adds it to the database. The `get_folders` method in sqlite\_registry returns a list of folder\_entry objects associated with the given SID.

**Note**:
The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of the fields that need to be updated for the folder\_entry object. However, it does not update the object itself. The developer should use this dictionary to update the object as per their requirements.

**Output Example**:
Here is a possible appearance of the code's return value when calling the `update_fields` method:
```python
{'policy_name': 'example_policy',
 'action': 'example_action',
 'delete_folder': 'False',
 'delete_sub_folders': 'False',
 'delete_files': 'False',
 'hidden_folder': 'False'}
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, fobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the properties of a folder\_entry object in the storage module of the gpoa project.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the object.
· fobj: An instance of a class that contains information about the file object.
· policy\_name: A string representing the name of the policy associated with the file object.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the properties of a folder\_entry object by setting the values of its attributes. The attributes include sid, policy\_name, path, action, delete\_folder, delete\_sub\_folders, delete\_files, and hidden\_folder.

The sid attribute is assigned the value of the sid parameter, which is a unique identifier for the object. The policy\_name attribute is assigned the value of the policy\_name parameter, which is a string representing the name of the policy associated with the file object.

The path attribute is assigned the value of the path attribute of the fobj parameter, which is an instance of a class that contains information about the file object. The action attribute is assigned the value of the action attribute of the fobj parameter, which is obtained by calling the value method on the action attribute.

The delete\_folder, delete\_sub\_folders, delete\_files, and hidden\_folder attributes are assigned the string values of the corresponding attributes of the fobj parameter. These attributes are obtained by calling the str function on the corresponding attributes of the fobj parameter.

**Note**:
· The sid parameter must be a unique identifier for the object.
· The fobj parameter must be an instance of a class that contains information about the file object.
· The policy\_name parameter must be a string representing the name of the policy associated with the file object.
· The path, action, delete\_folder, delete\_sub\_folders, delete\_files, and hidden\_folder attributes are initialized with the values of the corresponding attributes of the fobj parameter.
· The action attribute is obtained by calling the value method on the action attribute of the fobj parameter.

### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to return a list of fields to be updated.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it operates on the instance attributes of the class.

***
## ClassDef envvar_entry
 **envvar\_entry**: The function of envvar\_entry is to represent environment variables in an object mapping format.

**attributes**:
· sid: A string representing the SID (Security Identifier) of the user or group.
· policy\_name: A string representing the name of the policy.
· name: A string representing the name of the environment variable.
· value: A string representing the value of the environment variable.
· action: A string representing the action to be taken on the environment variable (e.g., create, delete, update).

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes the envvar\_entry object with the given SID, policy\_name, evobj (environment variable object), name, value, and action. The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of fields to be updated, including policy\_name, action, and value.

The envvar\_entry object is used in the sqlite\_registry class to manage environment variables in a SQLite database. The `add_envvar` method in sqlite\_registry creates a new envvar\_entry object and adds it to the database. If an exception occurs during the addition, the method updates the existing envvar\_entry object with the same name and SID. The `get_envvars` method in sqlite\_registry returns a list of envvar\_entry objects with the given SID.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the envvar\_entry object is not intended to be used independently but as part of the sqlite\_registry class. The `update_fields` method is used internally in the sqlite\_registry class and should not be called directly.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value when calling the `get_envvars` method in sqlite\_registry with a given SID:

```python
[
    envvar_entry(sid='S-1-5-21-123456789-123456789-123456789-12345', policy_name='test_policy', name='TEST_VAR', value='test_value', action='create'),
    envvar_entry(sid='S-1-5-21-123456789-123456789-123456789-12345', policy_name='test_policy2', name='TEST_VAR2', value='test_value2', action='create')
]
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, evobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the envvar\_entry object with the necessary attributes.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the environment variable entry.
· evobj: An object containing the name, value, and action of the environment variable.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the environment variable entry.

**Code Description**:
The \_\_init\_\_ function initializes an envvar\_entry object by setting its attributes. The first attribute set is sid (string), which is the unique identifier for the environment variable entry. The second attribute set is policy\_name (string), which is the name of the policy associated with the environment variable entry.

The next attribute set, name (string), is obtained from the evobj parameter. The evobj parameter is an object that contains the name, value, and action of the environment variable. By accessing evobj.name, the function sets the name attribute of the envvar\_entry object to the name of the environment variable.

Similarly, the value (string) and action (string) attributes are set for the envvar\_entry object. The value attribute is obtained by accessing evobj.value, and the action attribute is obtained by accessing evobj.action.value.

**Note**:
· The sid, policy\_name, name, and value attributes are mandatory and should be provided during the initialization of the envvar\_entry object.
· The action attribute is optional and can be omitted during initialization. If provided, it should be a string value.
· The evobj parameter should be an object containing the name, value, and action attributes.
· The name, value, and action attributes of the evobj parameter should be strings.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to return a dictionary of fields to be updated, including 'policy\_name', 'action', and 'value'.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function update\_fields is a method of the envvar\_entry class, which is used to create and return a dictionary of fields to be updated. It initializes an empty dictionary called fields and then assigns the values of 'policy\_name', 'action', and 'value' to this dictionary. These values are obtained from the instance variables of the envvar\_entry object. The function then returns the fields dictionary.

From a functional perspective, the update\_fields method is called by the add\_envvar method of the sqlite\_registry class. If an exception occurs during the execution of the add\_envvar method, the filter\_sid\_obj method is called, which filters the objects based on the 'sid' and 'name' attributes. The update method is then called, which updates the fields of the filtered objects using the fields dictionary returned by the update\_fields method.

**Note**:

* The update\_fields method is an internal method of the envvar\_entry class and should not be called directly.
* The method is designed to return a dictionary of fields to be updated, and it does not modify any objects or data in the system.

**Output Example**:

The output of the update\_fields method is a dictionary that looks like this:

```python
{'policy_name': 'policy_name_value', 'action': 'action_value', 'value': 'value_value'}
```

Where 'policy\_name\_value', 'action\_value', and 'value\_value' are the actual values of the instance variables of the envvar\_entry object.
***
## ClassDef script_entry
 **script\_entry**: The function of script\_entry is to represent scripts.ini objects with their corresponding attributes.

**attributes**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the script entry.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the script.
· action: The action associated with the script.
· number: The number associated with the script.
· path: The path associated with the script.
· arg: The argument associated with the script.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes the script\_entry object with the given parameters. It sets the attributes of the object to the input parameters.

The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of the fields to update for the script\_entry object. It creates a dictionary with the field names as keys and the corresponding attribute values as values.

This class is used in the `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py` module to map the script entries to the database using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) functionality. The `add_script` method in the `sqlite_registry` class creates a new `script_entry` object and adds it to the database. The `get_scripts` method retrieves the script entries associated with a given user and action from the database. The `wipe_user` method deletes the script entries associated with a given user from the database.

**Note**:
- The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of fields to update, but it is not currently used in the code.
- The `script_entry` class is used as a mapping object for the scripts table in the database.

**Output Example**:
```python
sid = '123456'
policy_name = 'test_policy'
scrobj = {'action': 'test_action', 'number': '1', 'path': '/path/to/script', 'args': 'test_args'}

script_entry_obj = script_entry(sid, scrobj, policy_name)
fields = script_entry_obj.update_fields()

print(fields)
# Output: {'policy_name': 'test_policy', 'action': 'test_action', 'number': '1', 'path': '/path/to/script', 'arg': 'test_args'}
```
This will create a new `script_entry` object with the given parameters and print the fields dictionary.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, scrobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the script\_entry object with the necessary attributes.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the script entry.
· scrobj: An object containing the action, number, path, and args attributes.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the script entry.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the script\_entry object by setting its attributes. The sid and policy\_name attributes are directly assigned to the input parameters. The action, number, path, and arg attributes are assigned from the scrobj object's attributes. This allows the script\_entry object to have its own copy of these attributes, rather than referencing the scrobj object directly.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the scrobj object has the necessary attributes (action, number, path, and args) before creating a script\_entry object. If any of these attributes are missing, a ValueError may be raised during initialization. Additionally, the sid and policy\_name parameters should be valid strings to avoid any unexpected behavior.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to return a list of fields to be updated.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it operates on the instance attributes of the script\_entry object.

***
## ClassDef file_entry
 **file\_entry**: The function of file\_entry is to represent an object mapping for FILES.XML.

**attributes**:
· sid: The unique identifier of the user or group.
· fileobj: An object containing file-related information.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the file.

**Code Description**:
The `file_entry` class is a mapping of an object representing FILES.XML. It takes three parameters during initialization: `sid`, `fileobj`, and `policy_name`. The `sid` parameter is the unique identifier of the user or group, `fileobj` is an object containing file-related information, and `policy_name` is the name of the policy associated with the file.

The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given parameters and assigns them to the respective instance variables.

The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of fields to update, which includes all the instance variables of the `file_entry` object.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The `file_entry` class is used in the `sqlite_registry` class in the `add_file` and `get_files` methods. In the `add_file` method, a new `file_entry` object is created and added to the database. In the `get_files` method, the method returns a filtered list of `file_entry` objects based on the given `sid`.

The `file_entry` class is also used in the `wipe_user` method of the `sqlite_registry` class, where it is used to wipe all the file entries associated with the given `sid`.

**Note**:
The `file_entry` class is an internal class used for object mapping and should not be used directly by the end-users.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how the `file_entry` object might look like:
```python
file_entry(sid='1234567890', fileobj={'action': 'copy', 'fromPath': '/path/to/file', 'targetPath': '/new/path/to/file', 'readOnly': False, 'archive': False, 'hidden': False, 'suppress': False, 'executable': False}, policy_name='MyPolicy')
```
This object represents a file entry with the `sid` of `1234567890`, associated with the `MyPolicy` policy, and has the file-related information of copying the file from `/path/to/file` to `/new/path/to/file`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, fileobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the file\_entry object with the necessary attributes.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the file entry object.
· fileobj: An object containing file metadata.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the file metadata.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the file\_entry object by setting its attributes with the provided parameters. The sid, policy\_name, and fileobj parameters are required to create a file\_entry object.

The file\_entry object's attributes include:
· self.sid: The unique identifier for the file entry object, set to the sid parameter.
· self.policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the file metadata, set to the policy\_name parameter.
· self.action: The action associated with the file metadata, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.fromPath: The original path of the file, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.targetPath: The target path of the file, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.readOnly: A boolean indicating whether the file is read-only, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.archive: A boolean indicating whether the file should be archived, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.hidden: A boolean indicating whether the file should be hidden, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.suppress: A boolean indicating whether the file should be suppressed, obtained from the fileobj parameter.
· self.executable: A boolean indicating whether the file is executable, obtained from the fileobj parameter.

**Note**:
· The fileobj parameter should be an object containing file metadata.
· The sid and policy\_name parameters are required to create a file\_entry object.
· The file\_entry object's attributes are set based on the provided parameters.
· Any missing attributes in the fileobj parameter will result in a None value for the corresponding file\_entry object attribute.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to return a list of fields to be updated in the file entry object.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it works on the instance attributes of the file\_entry object.

***
## ClassDef ini_entry
 **ini\_entry**: The function of ini\_entry is to represent an object mapping for INIFILES.XML.

**attributes**:
· sid: The security identifier (SID) of the user or group.
· iniobj: An instance of the iniobj class, which contains information about the INI file entries.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy.
· action: The action to be taken on the INI file entries.
· path: The path of the INI file.
· section: The section of the INI file.
· property: The property of the INI file.
· value: The value of the INI file.

**Code Description**:
The ini\_entry class is defined with the **`__init__`** method, which initializes the attributes of the class. The **`update_fields`** method returns a dictionary of fields to be updated.

The ini\_entry class is used in the sqlite\_registry class to handle INI file entries in a SQLite registry. The **`add_ini`** method in sqlite\_registry takes an sid, an iniobj, and a policy\_name as input, creates an instance of the ini\_entry class with these parameters, and then adds it to the database. If adding the ini\_entry instance raises an exception, the **`add_ini`** method filters the existing ini\_entry instances with the same sid and path, and updates them with the new ini\_entry instance's fields.

The **`get_ini`** method in sqlite\_registry takes a sid as input and returns a list of ini\_entry instances associated with that sid.

The **`wipe_user`** method in sqlite\_registry takes a sid as input and deletes all ini\_entry instances associated with that sid from the database.

**Note**:
When creating an instance of the ini\_entry class, make sure that the sid, iniobj, and policy\_name parameters are valid.

When using the **`add_ini`** method, be prepared to handle exceptions that may be raised when adding an ini\_entry instance to the database.

When using the **`get_ini`** method, note that it returns a list of ini\_entry instances, so you may need to iterate over the list to access individual instances.

When using the **`wipe_user`** method, note that it deletes all ini\_entry instances associated with the given sid, so use it with caution.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of creating an instance of the ini\_entry class:
```python
iniobj = iniobj('S-1-1-0', '/path/to/ini/file', 'my_policy')
entry = ini_entry('S-1-1-0', iniobj, 'my_policy')
```
Here is an example of using the **`add_ini`** method:
```python
sid = 'S-1-1-0'
iniobj = iniobj('S-1-1-0', '/path/to/ini/file', 'my_policy')
policy_name = 'my_policy'
sqlite_registry.add_ini(sid, iniobj, policy_name)
```
Here is an example of using the **`get_ini`** method:
```python
sid = 'S-1-1-0'
entries = sqlite_registry.get_ini(sid)
for entry in entries:
    print(entry.path)
```
Here is an example of using the **`wipe_user`** method:
```python
sid = 'S-1-1-0'
sqlite_registry.wipe_user(sid)
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, sid, iniobj, policy_name)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ini\_entry object with the necessary parameters.

**parameters**:
· sid: A unique identifier for the record.
· iniobj: An object containing the configuration data from an ini file.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy associated with the record.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ini\_entry object by setting the values of its attributes using the input parameters. The `sid` parameter is used to set the value of the `sid` attribute, while the `policy_name` parameter is used to set the value of the `policy_name` attribute. The `iniobj` parameter is an object that contains the configuration data from an ini file, and its attributes are used to set the values of the `action`, `path`, `section`, `property`, and `value` attributes of the ini\_entry object.

**Note**:
- The `iniobj` parameter is expected to be an object that contains the necessary attributes (`action`, `path`, `section`, `property`, and `value`) to initialize the ini\_entry object.
- The `sid` and `policy_name` parameters are used to uniquely identify the ini\_entry object and the policy associated with it.
- The `ini_entry` object is typically used in the context of a larger system that manages policies and their associated records.
- It is important to ensure that the `iniobj` parameter is properly validated and sanitized before passing it to the `ini_entry` constructor to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.

· abe: The ABE (Access-Based Enumeration) setting for the network share.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes the object with the given SID, network share object, and policy name. It assigns the corresponding attributes with the values from the network share object.

The `update_fields` method returns a dictionary of fields to be updated. It includes all the attributes of the object except the SID and policy name.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The `networkshare_entry` class is used in the `add_networkshare` and `get_networkshare` methods of the `sqlite_registry` class. In `add_networkshare`, a new `networkshare_entry` object is created and added to the database. In `get_networkshare`, the method returns a list of `networkshare_entry` objects that belong to the specified SID. The `wipe_user` method of the `sqlite_registry` class removes all `networkshare_entry` objects that belong to the specified SID.

**Note**:
The `update_fields` method should be called only after the object has been initialized with valid values.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of a `networkshare_entry` object:
```python
<networkshare_entry object at 0x7f8c6c2a3d60>
sid: S-1-5-21-123456789-123456789-123456789-1234
policy_name: SomePolicy
name: SomeNetworkShare
action: Allow
path: \\server\share
allRegular: False

· networkshareobj: An object containing information about the network share, such as its name, action, path, etc.
· policy\_name: The name of the Group Policy Object (GPO) to which this network share entry belongs.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the networkshare\_entry object by setting its attributes with the given parameters. The SID and policy\_name are directly assigned to the object's sid and policy\_name attributes, respectively. The networkshareobj parameter is an object that contains information about the network share, and its attributes are used to initialize the corresponding attributes of the networkshare\_entry object. Specifically, the name, action, path, allRegular, comment, limitUsers, and abe attributes of the networkshare\_entry object are set to the corresponding attributes of the networkshareobj object.

**Note**:
- The networkshareobj parameter should be an object that contains the necessary attributes to initialize the networkshare\_entry object.
- The sid and policy\_name parameters should be strings representing the SID and policy name, respectively.
- The networkshare\_entry object is initialized with the given parameters, and its attributes can be accessed or modified after initialization.
- The networkshare\_entry object does not perform any action or validation on the given parameters, so it is the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the parameters are valid and appropriate for the intended use.
***
### FunctionDef update_fields(self)
 **update\_fields**: The function of update\_fields is to return a list of fields to be updated.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it is an instance method that gets called on an object of the networkshare\_entry class.
