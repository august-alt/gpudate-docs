## ClassDef sqlite_registry
 **sqlite\_registry**: The `sqlite_registry` class is a concrete implementation of the abstract base class `registry` that stores and manages registry data in a SQLite database. It provides additional functionality specific to SQLite databases, such as support for SQLite-specific database features and SQLite-specific querying and retrieval methods.

**attributes**:
· `db_name`: A string representing the name of the SQLite database file.
· `db_path`: A string representing the file path of the SQLite database file.
· `db_cnt`: A SQLAlchemy `create_engine` object used to connect to the SQLite database.
· `db_session`: A SQLAlchemy `sessionmaker` object used to manage database transactions.
· `__compat`: A `sqlite_registry_compat` object used to provide compatibility between the `registry` class and the SQLite database.
· `__metadata`: A SQLAlchemy `MetaData` object used to define the structure of the SQLite database tables.
· `__info`, `__hklm`, `__hkcu`, `__shortcuts`, `__printers`, `__drives`, `__folders`, `__envvars`, `__scripts`, `__files`, `__ini`, `__networkshare`: SQLAlchemy `Table` objects representing the various tables in the SQLite database.

**Code Description**:
The `sqlite_registry` class is a concrete implementation of the `registry` abstract base class that provides additional functionality specific to SQLite databases. It initializes the database connection and sets up the necessary tables and mappers for storing registry data. The class also provides methods for adding, updating, and deleting registry entries, as well as for querying and retrieving entries based on a specific SID (Security Identifier).

The `sqlite_registry` class uses the SQLAlchemy library for database access and provides a convenient and flexible interface for working with registry data in a SQLite database. The class uses SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object Relational Mapper) functionality to map Python objects to database tables and provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with registry data.

The `sqlite_registry` class also provides a number of methods for querying and retrieving registry data based on a specific SID. These methods allow for easy filtering and retrieval of registry data based on the SID of the user or machine associated with the data.

The `sqlite_registry` class is used throughout the project to store and manage registry data in a SQLite database. It is typically instantiated using the `registry_factory` function in the `registry_factory` module, which provides a convenient way to create and manage `sqlite_registry` objects.

**Note**:

* The `sqlite_registry` class is a concrete implementation of the `registry` abstract base class and provides additional functionality specific to SQLite databases.
* The `sqlite_registry` class uses the SQLAlchemy library for database access and requires a working installation of SQLAlchemy to function properly.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, db_name, registry_cache_dir)
 **class gpoa.storage.record\_types.ini\_entry**

**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ini\_entry object with the given SID, iniobj, and policy\_name.

**parameters**:
· sid: The security identifier (SID) of the user or group.
· iniobj: An instance of the iniobj class, which contains information about the INI file entries.
· policy\_name: The name of the policy.

**Code Description**:
The ini\_entry class is used to represent INI file entries in the form of an object mapping. The __init__ method initializes the object with the given SID, iniobj, and policy\_name. It assigns the corresponding attributes with the values from the iniobj.

The ini\_entry class is used in the sqlite\_registry class to handle INI file entries in a SQLite registry. The add\_ini method in sqlite\_registry takes an sid, an iniobj, and a policy\_name as input, creates an instance of the ini\_entry class with these parameters, and then adds it to the database. If adding the ini\_entry instance raises an exception, the add\_ini method filters the existing ini\_entry instances with the same sid and path, and updates them with the new ini\_entry instance's fields.

The get\_ini method in sqlite\_registry takes a sid as input and returns a list of ini\_entry instances associated with that sid.

The wipe\_user method in sqlite\_registry takes a sid as input and deletes all ini\_entry instances associated with that sid from the database.

**Note
***
### FunctionDef _add(self, row)
 **_add**: The function of `_add` is to add a given row to the database session and commit the transaction.

**parameters**:
· `row`: The object to be added to the database.

**Code Description**:
The `_add` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database session using the `db_session.add(row)` method. If the addition is successful, the database session is committed using `db_session.commit()`. If an exception occurs during the execution, the function catches it, rolls back the database session to undo any changes made in the current transaction using `db_session.rollback()`, and re-raises the exception to be handled by the caller.

This function serves as a helper method for other functions in the project that need to add new records to the database. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.

**Note**:
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of a database model class, as it will be directly added to the database session.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
***
### FunctionDef _info_upsert(self, row)
 **`_info_upsert`**: The function of `_info_upsert` is to add a new `info_entry` object to the SQLite database or update an existing one with the same name.

**parameters**:
· `row`: The `info_entry` object to be added or updated in the database.

**Code Description**:
The `_info_upsert` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database session using the `_add` method. If adding the object raises an exception (e.g., due to a unique constraint violation), the function catches the exception and proceeds to update the existing object with the same name instead.

To update the existing object, the function queries the database for the object with the same name as the provided `row` object using the `db_session.query(info_entry).filter(info_entry.name == row.name)` method. It then updates the object's fields using the `update` method and the dictionary returned by the `row.update_fields()` method. Finally, the function commits the transaction using `db_session.commit()`.

This function serves as a helper method for the `set_info` method in the `sqlite_registry` class, which is responsible for inserting or updating global policy settings for a system. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.

From a functional perspective, the `_info_upsert` function plays a crucial role in the `set_info` method. When a new `info_entry` object is created, it is first attempted to be inserted into the database using the `_add` method. If the insertion fails, the `_info_upsert` function is called to update the existing object with the same name.

**Note**:
- When creating a new `info_entry` object, make sure the name is unique among all other `info_entry` objects in the database. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `info_entry` class, as it will be directly added to the database session or used to update an existing object.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.

**Related Objects**:
- `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py/sqlite_registry/_add`: This function is responsible for adding a given row to the database session and committing the transaction.
- `gpoa/storage/record_types.py/info_entry`: This class represents a piece of information with a name and a value, and is used to store global policy settings for a system in a SQLite database.
- `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py/sqlite_registry/set_info`: This function is responsible for setting the value of a global policy setting in the SQLite database. It creates a new `info_entry` object and calls the `_info_upsert` function to insert or update the object in the database.
***
### FunctionDef _hklm_upsert(self, row)
 **`_hklm_upsert`**: The function of `_hklm_upsert` is to add a given row to the database session and commit the transaction, or update the existing row if a unique constraint violation occurs during the addition.

**parameters**:
· `row`: The object to be added or updated in the database. This object is an instance of the `samba_preg` class, which represents an entry in the HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) registry.

**Code Description**:
The `_hklm_upsert` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database session using the `_add` method. If the addition is successful, the database session is committed using `db_session.commit()`.

If a unique constraint violation occurs during the addition, it means that a row with the same `hive_key` value already exists in the database. In this case, the function catches the exception, queries the existing row with the same `hive_key` value, and updates it with the new values from the `row` object using the `update` method. The database session is then committed using `db_session.commit()`.

This function serves as a helper method for the `add_hklm_entry` method in the `sqlite_registry` class, which needs to add new entries to the HKLM table in the SQLite database or update existing entries if a unique constraint violation occurs. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The `_hklm_upsert` method is called by the `add_hklm_entry` method in the `sqlite_registry` class. The `add_hklm_entry` method takes two parameters, `preg_entry` and `policy_name`, and creates a `samba_preg` object with these parameters. It then calls the `_hklm_upsert` method with the created `samba_preg` object to add or update the entry in the HKLM table.

**Note**:
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `samba_preg` class, as it will be directly added or updated in the database.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
- The `_hklm_upsert` function assumes that the `hive_key` attribute of the `row` object is unique in the database. If this assumption is violated, the function may update the wrong row or fail to update any row. Make sure to enforce the uniqueness of the `hive_key` attribute in the database schema or in the application logic.
***
### FunctionDef _hkcu_upsert(self, row)
 **`_hkcu_upsert`**: The function of `_hkcu_upsert` is to update or insert a given HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER) registry entry in the SQLite database.

**parameters**:
· `row`: An instance of the `samba_hkcu_preg` class representing the HKCU registry entry to be updated or inserted.

**Code Description**:
The `_hkcu_upsert` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database session using the `_add` method. If adding the row raises an exception (which could occur if the row's SID or hive_key already exists in the database), the function will catch the exception and proceed to update the existing row in the database with the new values from `row.update_fields()`.

The `row.update_fields()` method returns a dictionary containing the `policy_name`, `type`, and `data` attributes of the `row` object. This dictionary is used to update the existing row in the database. After updating the row, the database session is committed using `db_session.commit()`.

This function is designed to handle situations where a new HKCU registry entry needs to be inserted into the database or an existing entry needs to be updated with new values. By handling exceptions and updating existing entries, it ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The `_hkcu_upsert` function is primarily called by the `add_hkcu_entry` function in the `sqlite_registry` class, which is responsible for writing PReg entries to the HKCU registry. When a new PReg entry is added, the `add_hkcu_entry` function creates a `samba_hkcu_preg` object representing the entry and passes it to `_hkcu_upsert` for insertion or update in the SQLite database.

**Note**:
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `samba_hkcu_preg` class, as it will be directly added to the database session or used to update an existing row.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
- The `_hkcu_upsert` function assumes that the `row` object has the necessary attributes (`sid`, `hive_key`, and `update_fields()` method) to perform the insert or update operation. Make sure that the `row` object meets these requirements before calling this function.
***
### FunctionDef _shortcut_upsert(self, row)
 **`_shortcut_upsert`**: The function of `_shortcut_upsert` is to add a shortcut entry to the database or update an existing entry if a unique constraint violation occurs.

**parameters**:
· `row`: An instance of the `ad_shortcut` class, which contains the shortcut information to be added or updated.

**Code Description**:
The `_shortcut_upsert` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database using the `_add` method (line 2). If a unique constraint violation occurs, the function catches the exception and proceeds to update the existing record in the database (lines 4-7). The `update_fields` method of the `row` object is called to create a dictionary containing the policy\_name, path, and shortcut attributes, which are then used to update the existing record. The database session is then committed (line 7).

The `_shortcut_upsert` function is called by the `add_shortcut` method in the `sqlite_registry` class (line 4 in the `add_shortcut` code). The `add_shortcut` method takes three parameters: `sid`, `sc_obj`, and `policy_name`. It creates an instance of the `ad_shortcut` class with these parameters and calls the `_shortcut_upsert` method to add or update the shortcut entry in the database.

The `_shortcut_upsert` function plays a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and atomicity of the database operations. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even in the event of a unique constraint violation.

**Note**:
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `ad_shortcut` class, as it will be directly added to the database session.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
- The `_shortcut_upsert` function assumes that the `db_session` attribute has been properly initialized and configured in the caller function. Make sure to properly initialize and configure the `db_session` attribute before calling this function.
- The `_shortcut_upsert` function relies on the `_add` method to add new records to the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the `_add` method to ensure data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.
- The `_shortcut_upsert` function relies on the `update_fields` method of the `ad_shortcut` class to create a dictionary containing the policy\_name, path, and shortcut attributes. Make sure that the `update_fields` method is properly implemented and returns the expected dictionary.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of how the `_shortcut_upsert` function is used in the `add_shortcut` method:
```python
sid = '12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab'
sc_obj = Shortcut('C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\shortcut.lnk')
policy_name = 'My Policy'

registry = sqlite_registry('my_registry')
registry.add_shortcut(sid, sc_obj, policy_name)
```
In this example, the `add_shortcut` method is used to store shortcut information in the database using the `_shortcut_upsert` function. The `sid` parameter is a unique identifier for the shortcut's owner, `sc_obj` is an object of the `Shortcut` class representing the shortcut, and `policy_name` is the name of the policy associated with the shortcut. If a unique constraint violation occurs, the `_shortcut_upsert` function will update the existing record in the database with the new policy\_name, path, and shortcut attributes.
***
### FunctionDef _printer_upsert(self, row)
 **_printer_upsert**: The function of `_printer_upsert` is to add a new printer entry or update an existing one in the SQLite database. It first attempts to add the provided `printer_entry` object to the database session using the `_add` function. If an exception occurs during this operation, it filters the existing printer entries based on the SID and name, and updates them with the new fields.

**parameters**:
· `row`: The `printer_entry` object to be added or updated in the database.

**Code Description**:
The `_printer_upsert` function begins by calling the `_add` function to add the provided `row` object to the database session and commit the transaction. If an exception occurs during this operation, it proceeds to filter the existing printer entries based on the SID and name using the `db_session.query(printer_entry).filter()` method. It then updates the filtered entries with the new fields using the `update()` method and commits the transaction using `db_session.commit()`.

This function serves as a helper method for the `add_printer` function in the `sqlite_registry` class to either add a new printer entry or update an existing one in the database. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations.

**Note**:
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `printer_entry` class, as it will be directly added to the database session.

***
### FunctionDef _drive_upsert(self, row)
 **`_drive_upsert`**: The function of `_drive_upsert` is to add a new drive entry or update an existing one in the SQLite registry.

**parameters**:
· `row`: An instance of the `drive_entry` class, which contains the drive entry details such as SID, policy name, login, password, and other relevant attributes.

**Code Description**:
The `_drive_upsert` function begins by attempting to add the provided `row` object to the database session using the `_add` method. If adding the row raises an exception (which could occur due to a unique constraint violation, for example), the function catches the exception and proceeds to update the existing record in the database with the new values of the object's attributes.

The update process involves querying the database for the record with the same SID and dir attributes as the `row` object, and then updating that record with the new values returned by the `update_fields` method of the `row` object. The `update_fields` method creates a dictionary of the object's attributes, which are then used to update the existing record.

After updating the record, the function commits the database session using `db_session.commit()`.

This function is called by the `add_drive` method of the `sqlite_registry` class, which creates a new `drive_entry` object and inserts or updates it in the database using the `_drive_upsert` method.

**Note**:
- The `_drive_upsert` function assumes that the `row` object has the necessary attributes, and if any attribute is missing, it will result in an error.
- The function directly interacts with the database, so be cautious when using it and make sure to handle exceptions and rollbacks appropriately in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `row` object provided to this function is a valid instance of the `drive_entry` class, as it will be directly added to the database session or used to update an existing record.

***
### FunctionDef set_info(self, name, value)
 **set\_info**: The function of `set_info` is to add a new `info_entry` object to the SQLite database or update an existing one with the same name in the `sqlite_registry` object.

**parameters**:
· `name`: A string that represents the name of the `info_entry` object.
· `value`: An arbitrary Python object that represents the value of the `info_entry` object.

**Code Description**:
The `set_info` function begins by creating a new `info_entry` object with the given `name` and `value` parameters. It then logs the new `info_entry` object's name and value using the `log` function from the `gpoa/util/logging.py` module.

After logging the new `info_entry` object, the function calls the `_info_upsert` method of the `sqlite_registry` object to add or update the new `info_entry` object in the SQLite database. The `_info_upsert` method takes care of handling any exceptions that may arise due to unique constraint violations and updates the existing object with the same name instead.

The `set_info` function is called in the `__init__` methods of the `nodomain_backend` and `samba_backend` classes in the `gpoa/backend` module. These classes use the `set_info` function to set the initial values of the `domain`, `machine_name`, `machine_sid`, `username`, and `sid` attributes of the `sqlite_registry` object.

By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, the `_info_upsert` method ensures data consistency and atomicity of the database operations. Therefore, the `set_info` function plays a crucial role in setting the initial values of the `sqlite_registry` object's attributes.

**Related Objects**:
· `gpoa/util/logging.py/log`: This function is responsible for logging messages with different levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, fatal) and data dictionaries.
· `gpoa/storage/sqlite_registry.py/sqlite_registry/_info_upsert`: This function is responsible for adding a new `info_entry` object to the database session or updating an existing one with the same name.

· `gpoa/backend/samba_backend.py/samba_backend/__init__`: This function is responsible for initializing the `samba_backend` object with the `sqlite_registry` object and setting its initial values.

**Note**:
- When creating a new `info_entry` object, make sure the name is unique among all other `info_entry` objects in the database. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.
- Be cautious when using this function, as it directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the `name` and `value` parameters provided to this function are valid and appropriate for the `info_entry` object being created or updated.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
- The `set_info` function is called in the `__init__` methods of the `nodomain_backend` and `samba_backend` classes. Therefore, any exceptions raised during the execution of the `set_info` function will be propagated to these classes' `__init__` methods.
***
### FunctionDef _delete_hklm_keyname(self, keyname)
 **`_delete_hklm_keyname`**: The function of `_delete_hklm_keyname` is to delete a registry key from the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE (HKLM) hive using the provided `keyname`.

**parameters**
· `keyname`: A string that holds the name of the registry key to be deleted from the HKLM hive.

**Code Description**
The `_delete_hklm_keyname` function is a method of the `sqlite_registry` class, which is responsible for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the HKLM table in the SQLite database.

The function takes one parameter, `keyname`, which is a string representing the name of the registry key to be deleted. It first creates a dictionary `logdata` with the `keyname` as a key and an empty string as its value. This dictionary is used to log the operation details.

The function then begins a transaction by calling the `db_session.query` method on the `samba_preg` class and filtering the query results based on the `keyname` parameter. The `delete` method is called on the query results, and the `synchronize_session` parameter is set to `False` to avoid synchronizing the session with the database.

After the deletion, the `db_session.commit` method is called to commit the transaction to the database. The `log` function is then called with the `D65` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the successful deletion of the registry key.

If an exception occurs during the execution of the function, the `log` function is called with the `D63` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the failure of the deletion operation.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**
The `_delete_hklm_keyname` function is called by the `add_hklm_entry` method of the `sqlite_registry` class. The `add_hklm_entry` method takes two parameters, `preg_entry` and `policy_name`. The `preg_entry` parameter is an object that contains the properties of a registry key, and the `policy_name` parameter is a string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.

The `add_hklm_entry` method calls the `samba_preg` class constructor to create a `samba_preg` object from the `preg_entry` parameter. It then checks if the `valuename` attribute of the `samba_preg` object starts with `**`. If it does, the `_delete_hklm_keyname` function is called with the `keyname` attribute of the `samba_preg` object as the parameter.

**Note**
The `_delete_hklm_keyname` function is an internal method of the `sqlite_registry` class and should not be used outside of it. It is recommended to use the `add_hklm_entry` method to add or delete registry keys from the HKLM hive.

Here's an example of how to use the `add_hklm_entry` method to delete a registry key:

```python
registry = sqlite_registry('my_database')
registry.add_hklm_entry({'keyname': 'Software', 'valuename': 'Microsoft'}, 'MyPolicy')
```

In this example, the `add_hklm_entry` method is called with the `preg_entry` parameter set to `{'keyname': 'Software', 'valuename': 'Microsoft'}` and the `policy_name` parameter set to `'MyPolicy'`. The `valuename` attribute of the `samba_preg` object created from the `preg_entry` parameter starts with `**`, so the `_delete_hklm_keyname` function is called with the `keyname` attribute of the `samba_preg` object as the parameter. The registry key with the name `Software` is then deleted from the HKLM hive.
***
### FunctionDef add_hklm_entry(self, preg_entry, policy_name)
 **add\_hklm\_entry**: The function of add\_hklm\_entry is to write a PReg entry to the HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE registry hive. It takes two parameters: preg\_entry and policy\_name. The preg\_entry parameter is an instance of the samba\_preg class, which represents an entry in the HKLM registry. The policy\_name parameter is a string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.

**parameters**
· preg\_entry: An instance of the samba\_preg class representing an entry in the HKLM registry.
· policy\_name: A string that holds the name of the policy associated with the registry key.

**Code Description**
The add\_hklm\_entry function first creates a samba\_preg object called pentry from the preg\_entry parameter. It then checks if the valuename attribute of the pentry object starts with '**'. If it does, the function calls the _delete\_hklm\_keyname method with the keyname attribute of the pentry object as the parameter. This is done to delete the registry key associated with the pentry object.

If the valuename attribute of the pentry object does not start with '**', the function calls the _hklm\_upsert method with the pentry object as the parameter. This method adds or updates the entry in the HKLM table of the SQLite database. If a unique constraint violation occurs during the addition, the function catches the exception, queries the existing row with the same hive\_key value, and updates it with the new values from the pentry object. The database session is then committed using db\_session.commit().

The add\_hklm\_entry function serves as a helper method for the merge\_polfile method in the preg module. The merge\_polfile method takes a preg file and a registry storage object as parameters and adds the entries in the preg file to the registry storage object. The add\_hklm\_entry method is called with the entries in the preg file and the policy\_name parameter to add or update the entries in the HKLM table of the SQLite database.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**
The add\_hklm\_entry function is called by the merge\_polfile method in the preg module. The merge\_polfile method takes a preg file and a registry storage object as parameters and adds the entries in the preg file to the registry storage object. The add\_hklm\_entry method is called with the entries in the preg file and the policy\_name parameter to add or update the entries in the HKLM table of the SQLite database.

**Note**
- The add\_hklm\_entry function directly interacts with the database. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and rollbacks in the caller function.
- Ensure that the pentry object provided to this function is a valid instance of the samba\_preg class, as it will be directly added or updated in the database.
- When using this function in a transaction, make sure to commit or rollback the session appropriately after the operation to maintain data consistency.
- The add\_hklm\_entry function assumes that the hive\_key attribute of the pentry object is unique in the database. If this assumption is violated, the function may update the wrong row or fail to update any row. Make sure to enforce the uniqueness of the hive\_key attribute in the database schema or in the application logic.

### FunctionDef _delete_hkcu_keyname(self, keyname, sid)
 **`_delete_hkcu_keyname`**: The function of `_delete_hkcu_keyname` is to delete a specific key-value pair from the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER registry hive based on the provided `keyname` and `sid`.

**parameters**:
· `keyname`: A string representing the name of the registry key to be deleted.
· `sid`: A string representing the Security Identifier (SID) of the user associated with the HKCU entry.

**Code Description**:
The `_delete_hkcu_keyname` function is defined within the `sqlite_registry` class and takes two parameters: `keyname` and `sid`. It first initializes a `logdata` dictionary containing the `sid` and `keyname` parameters. Then, it begins a try-except block to handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the function.

Within the try block, the function performs a double filter query on the `samba_hkcu_preg` table using the `db_session` object to find the specific key-value pair to be deleted. The first filter is based on the `sid` parameter, and the second filter is based on the `keyname` parameter. The `delete` method is then called on the resulting query object with `synchronize_session=False` to delete the matching record from the database.

After the deletion, the `db_session` object is committed using the `commit` method. The `log` function is then called with the `D66` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the successful deletion of the key-value pair.

If any exception occurs during the execution of the try block, the except block is executed, and the `log` function is called with the `D64` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the failure of the deletion operation.

The `_delete_hkcu_keyname` function is primarily used in the `add_hkcu_entry` function of the `sqlite_registry` class to delete existing key-value pairs when adding new ones. It is also used in the `wipe_user` function to delete all key-value pairs associated with a specific user.

**Note**:
When using the `_delete_hkcu_keyname` function, ensure that the `keyname` and `sid` parameters are correctly set according to the target key-value pair in the Windows registry. Additionally, note that the function will delete the specific key-value pair and all its sub-keys and values. Therefore, use this function with caution, especially when deleting keys associated with critical system functionalities.
***
### FunctionDef add_hkcu_entry(self, preg_entry, sid, policy_name)
 **add\_hkcu\_entry**: The function of add\_hkcu\_entry is to write a PReg entry to the HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER registry hive.

**parameters**:
· `preg_entry`: An instance of the `samba_hkcu_preg` class representing the PReg entry to be written.
· `sid`: A string representing the Security Identifier (SID) of the user associated with the HKCU entry.
· `policy_name`: A string specifying the name of the policy applied to the HKCU entry.

**Code Description**:
The `add_hkcu_entry` function begins by creating a `samba_hkcu_preg` object, `hkcu_pentry`, using the provided `sid`, `preg_entry`, and `policy_name` parameters. This object represents the PReg entry to be written to the HKCU registry hive.

Next, a `logdata` dictionary is initialized with the `sid`, `policy_name`, and `hkcu_pentry.hive_key` as keys and their respective values. This dictionary is used to log the entry addition operation using the `log` function.

The function then checks if the `hkcu_pentry.valuename` starts with `'**'`. If it does, the function performs different actions based on the value of `hkcu_pentry.valuename`. If the value is `'**delvals.'`, the `_delete_hkcu_keyname` function is called with the `hkcu_pentry.keyname` and `sid` parameters to delete the existing key-value pair. Otherwise, the `log` function is called with the `D51` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the failure of the entry addition operation.

If the `hkcu_pentry.valuename` does not start with `'**'`, the function checks if the `hkcu_pentry.valuename` starts with `'**delvals.'`. If it does, the `_delete_hkcu_keyname` function is called with the `hkcu_pentry.keyname` and `sid` parameters to delete the existing key-value pair. Otherwise, the `log` function is called with the `D26` message code and the `logdata` dictionary as parameters to log the successful addition of the entry. After logging, the `_hkcu_upsert` function is called with the `hkcu_pentry` object to update or insert the HKCU registry entry in the SQLite database.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The `add_hkcu_entry` function is primarily called by the `merge_polfile` function in the `preg` module. The `merge_polfile` function reads a PReg file and calls `add_hkcu_entry` for each entry in the file to write the entries to the HKCU registry hive.

**Note**:
When using the `add_hkcu_entry` function, ensure that the `preg_entry`, `sid`, and `policy_name` parameters are correctly set according to the target HKCU entry in the Windows registry. Additionally, note that the function will delete the specific key-value pair and all its sub-keys and values if the `hkcu_pentry.valuename` starts with `'**'` and has a value of `'**delvals.'`. Therefore, use this function with caution, especially when deleting keys associated with critical system functionalities.

**Code Description**:
The add\_shortcut function begins by creating an instance of the ad\_shortcut class, passing in the sid, sc\_obj, and policy\_name parameters (line 2). The ad\_shortcut class is a mapping representation of a Windows shortcut object, which has four attributes: sid, policy\_name, path, and shortcut.

The function then creates a dictionary called logdata, which contains the link and sid attributes (line 3). The link attribute is set to the path attribute of the ad\_shortcut instance, and the sid attribute is set to the sid attribute of the ad\_shortcut instance.

The function then calls the log() function, passing in the message code 'D41' and the logdata dictionary (line 4). The log() function logs the message code and data to the log file.

Finally, the function calls the _shortcut\_upsert() method of the sqlite\_registry instance, passing in the ad\_shortcut instance (line 5). The _shortcut\_upsert() method adds the ad\_shortcut instance to the database or updates an existing entry if a unique constraint violation occurs.

The add\_shortcut function is called by the add\_shortcut() method in the sqlite\_registry class (line 4 in the sqlite\_registry code). The add\_shortcut() method takes three parameters: sid, sc\_obj, and policy\_name. It creates an instance of the ad\_shortcut class with these parameters and calls the add\_shortcut() method to add or update the shortcut entry in the database.

The add\_shortcut function plays a crucial role in ensuring data consistency and atomicity of the database operations. By handling exceptions and rolling back the database session, it ensures that the database remains in a consistent state even in the event of a unique constraint violation.

**Note**:

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of how the add\_shortcut function is used in the sqlite\_registry module:
```python
sid = '12345678-1234-1234-1234-1234567890ab'
sc_obj = Shortcut('C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\shortcut.lnk')
policy_name = 'My Policy'

registry = sqlite_registry('my_registry')
registry.add_shortcut(sid, sc_obj, policy_name)
```
In this example, the add\_shortcut function is used to store shortcut information in the database. The sid parameter is a unique identifier for the shortcut's owner, sc\_obj is an object of the Shortcut class representing the shortcut, and policy\_name is the name of the policy associated with the shortcut. If a unique constraint violation occurs, the _shortcut\_upsert() method will update the existing record in the database with the new policy\_name, path, and shortcut attributes.

### FunctionDef _filter_sid_obj(self, row_object, sid)
 **`_filter_sid_obj`**: The function of `_filter_sid_obj` is to filter a row object based on a specified SID (Security Identifier).

**parameters**:
· `row_object`: The database model class that represents the table to be queried.
· `sid`: The Security Identifier (SID) to be used in the filtering process.

**Code Description**:
The function `_filter_sid_obj` is a method of the `sqlite_registry` class, which takes two parameters: `row_object` and `sid`. The purpose of this function is to filter rows in the database table represented by the `row_object` parameter where the `sid` column matches the provided `sid` value.

The function begins by creating a query using the `db_session.query()` method with the `row_object` parameter. This query is then filtered using the `filter()` method, which checks if the `sid` column of the queried table matches the provided `sid` value.

The resulting query is then returned by the function. If there are no matching rows in the table, an empty queryset will be returned.

**Relation with Callers**:
The function `_filter_sid_obj` is utilized in various methods of the `sqlite_registry` class, such as `add_folder`, `add_envvar`, `add_script`, `add_file`, `add_ini`, and `add_networkshare`. In these methods, if an exception occurs during the addition of a new entry, the existing entry with the same SID and other attributes is updated instead. The `_filter_sid_obj` function is used to filter the existing entries based on the provided SID and specific attributes, which are then updated using the `update()` method.

**Note**:
When using the `_filter_sid_obj` function, ensure that the `row_object` parameter corresponds to the correct database table model class and that the `sid` parameter contains a valid SID value.

**Output Example**:

· hive\_key (str): A string formed by concatenating keyname and valuename with a backslash, representing the full path of the registry key-value pair.

**Code Description**:
The get\_hkcu\_entry function first queries the SQLite database using the db\_session object, filtering for the samba\_hkcu\_preg object with the matching sid and hive\_key. If a result is found, the function returns the object directly. If no result is found, the function tries to get the value from the machine SID as a default. It queries the SQLite database again, filtering for the samba\_hkcu\_preg object with the machine SID and the same hive\_key. If a result is found, the function returns the object. Otherwise, it returns None.

The samba\_hkcu\_preg object represents an HKCU (HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER) entry in the Windows registry, which is a key-value pair with a Security Identifier (SID). The sid attribute is the SID of the user associated with the HKCU entry. The hive\_key attribute is the full path of the registry key-value pair.

The get\_hkcu\_entry function is primarily used in the gpoa/frontend/cifs\_applier.py/cifs\_applier\_user/check\_enable\_home\_link, gpoa/frontend/gsettings\_applier.py/gsettings\_applier\_user/windows\_mapping\_append, and gpoa/frontend/gsettings\_applier.py/gsettings\_applier\_user/admin\_context\_apply functions to retrieve the samba\_hkcu\_preg object based on the provided SID and hive\_key.

**Note**:
The get\_hkcu\_entry function assumes that a result will be found in the database for the given SID and hive\_key. If no result is found, the function will return None.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Example usage of get_hkcu_entry function

· `startswith`: A string specifying the beginning part of the hive key to filter the entries.

**Code Description**:
The filter_hkcu_entries function is defined within the sqlite_registry class in the sqlite_registry.py module. It takes two parameters, sid and startswith, and returns a query result that matches the specified conditions.

The function first initializes a query by calling the db_session attribute of the sqlite_registry class, which is an instance of SQLAlchemy's Session class. It then applies filters to the query by calling the filter method twice, once for the sid and another for the hive_key attribute of the samba_hkcu_preg class. The like operator is used in the second filter to match the startswith parameter.

By returning the res object, the filter_hkcu_entries function enables further processing of the query result, such as fetching all matching entries or iterating over them.

**Relationship with its callers in the project**:
The filter_hkcu_entries function is primarily used in the frontend modules of the gpoa project, specifically in gsettings_applier.py, kde_applier.py, and package_applier.py. In these modules, the function is utilized to filter HKCU entries based on specific SIDs and string patterns, allowing for targeted manipulation of registry settings.

**Note**:
When using the filter_hkcu_entries function, ensure that the provided sid and startswith parameters are correctly formatted and match the desired HKCU entries in the Windows registry.

**Output Example**:

### FunctionDef get_info(self, name)
 **get\_info**: The function of get\_info is to retrieve the value of a specified info entry from the SQLite registry.

**parameters**:
· name (str): The unique name of the info entry.

**Code Description**:
The get\_info function takes in a single parameter, name, which is a string representing the unique name of the info entry. It then queries the SQLite database using the db\_session object, filtering for the info entry with the matching name. If a result is found, the function returns the value attribute of the info entry.

The SQLite registry is implemented as a SQLite database with a table for storing info entries. Each info entry has a name and a value attribute, with the name serving as the unique identifier for the entry. The SQLite registry is used to store global policy settings for a system.

The get\_info function is called by the retrieve\_and\_store function in the nodomain\_backend and samba\_backend modules. In both cases, the function is used to retrieve the value of a specific info entry from the SQLite registry.

In the nodomain\_backend module, the function is used to retrieve the value of the 'machine\_sid' info entry, which represents the security identifier (SID) of the machine. This value is then used to wipe the HKLM and HKU hives of the registry, which contain machine-level and user-level settings, respectively.

In the samba\_backend module, the function is used to retrieve the value of the 'domain' info entry, which represents the name of the domain to which the machine belongs. This value is then used to set the domain name in the storage object.

**Note**:
The get\_info function assumes that a result will be found in the database for the given name. If no result is found, the function will raise a AttributeError.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Example usage of get_info function
registry = sqlite_registry()
domain_name = registry.get_info('domain')
print(domain_name)  # Output: 'example.com'
```
In this example, the get\_info function is called with the parameter 'domain'. The function queries the SQLite registry for the info entry with the name 'domain' and returns its value. The returned value is then printed to the console.

### FunctionDef get_hklm_entry(self, hive_key)
 **get\_hklm\_entry**: The function of get\_hklm\_entry is to retrieve an entry from the HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) table in the SQLite database based on the provided hive\_key.

**parameters**
· hive\_key: A string that holds the full path of the registry key in the format of `{keyname}\{valuename}`.

**Code Description**
The get\_hklm\_entry function is a method of the sqlite\_registry class. It takes one parameter, hive\_key, which is a string that holds the full path of the registry key in the format of `{keyname}\{valuename}`.

The function queries the SQLite database using the db\_session object and returns the first result that matches the filter condition where the hive\_key attribute of the samba\_preg object is equal to the provided hive\_key.

The samba\_preg object is an internal class of the sqlite\_registry class and is used to represent an object mapping for HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) entry in the Windows registry. It holds the properties of a registry key without the SID (Security Identifier).

The get\_hklm\_entry function is used in various parts of the project to retrieve entries from the HKLM table in the SQLite database. It is called in the get\_policy\_mode method of the samba\_backend class to retrieve the UserPolicyMode parameter value in order to determine if it is possible to work with the user's part of GPT. It is also called in the check\_experimental\_enabled, check\_windows\_mapping\_enabled, and check\_module\_enabled methods of the applier\_frontend class to retrieve the values of specific registry keys to determine if certain features are enabled.

Additionally, the get\_hklm\_entry function is called in the \_\_init\_\_ method of the firewall\_applier class to retrieve the value of the firewall\_switch registry key, and in the run method of the ntp\_applier class to retrieve the values of the ntp\_server\_type, ntp\_server\_address\_key, ntp\_server\_enabled, and ntp\_client\_enabled registry keys.

**Note**
The samba\_preg class is an internal class of the sqlite\_registry class and should not be used outside of it.

**Output Example**
Here's an example of how to use the get\_hklm\_entry method of the sqlite\_registry class:

```python
registry = sqlite_registry('my_database')
hive_key = 'Software\\BaseALT\\Policies\\GPUpdate\\GlobalExperimental'
entry = registry.get_hklm_entry(hive_key)
print(entry.policy_name) # Output: GlobalExperimental
print(entry.hive_key) # Output: Software\BaseALT\Policies\GPUpdate\GlobalExperimental
print(entry.type) # Output: 1 (for example)
print(entry.data) # Output: 1 (for example)
```

In this example, the get\_hklm\_entry method is called with the hive\_key parameter set to 'Software\\BaseALT\\Policies\\GPUpdate\\GlobalExperimental'. The method returns an instance of the samba\_preg class, which holds the properties of the registry key associated with the provided hive\_key. The policy\_name, hive\_key, type, and data attributes of the returned object are printed as an example.

### FunctionDef filter_hklm_entries(self, startswith)
 **filter\_hklm\_entries**: The function of `filter_hklm_entries` is to filter the HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) entries in the Windows registry based on a given prefix string.

**parameters**:
· `startswith`: A string that specifies the prefix to filter the HKLM entries.

**Code Description**:
The `filter_hklm_entries` function is a method of the `sqlite_registry` class, which is defined in the `sqlite_registry.py` module. It takes a single parameter `startswith`, which is a string that specifies the prefix to filter the HKLM entries.

The function uses the `db_session` attribute of the `sqlite_registry` class to query the `samba_preg` objects from the SQLite database. The `db_session` attribute is an instance of the SQLAlchemy `Session` class, which provides a handle to the database session and allows executing database queries.

The `query` method of the `db_session` object is called with the `samba_preg` class as an argument, which specifies that the query should return the `samba_preg` objects. The `filter` method is then called on the query object to filter the `samba_preg` objects based on the `startswith` parameter. Specifically, the `hive_key` attribute of each `samba_preg` object is compared with the `startswith` parameter using the `like` operator, which performs a prefix match.

Finally, the `all` method is called on the filtered query object to execute the query and return a list of `samba_preg` objects that match the `startswith` parameter.

The `filter_hklm_entries` function is used in various parts of the project to filter the HKLM entries based on a given prefix string. For example, it is used in the `control_applier`, `firewall_applier`, `kde_applier`, `package_applier`, `polkit_applier`, and `yandex_browser_applier` modules to filter the HKLM entries that correspond to the respective policies or settings.

**Note**:
The `filter_hklm_entries` function is an internal method of the `sqlite_registry` class and should not be used outside of it.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how to use the `filter_hklm_entries` method in the `sqlite_registry` class:

```python
registry = sqlite_registry('my_database')
hklm_entries = registry.filter_hklm_entries('Software\\Microsoft')
for entry in hklm_entries:
    print(entry.hive_key)
```

In this example, the `filter_hklm_entries` method is called with the prefix string `'Software\\Microsoft'`, which filters the HKLM entries that have a `hive_key` attribute that starts with `'Software\Microsoft'`. The method returns a list of `samba_preg` objects that match the prefix string, which are then printed to the console.

### FunctionDef wipe_user(self, sid)
 **wipe\_user**: The function of wipe\_user is to delete all records associated with a given user from the SQLite database.

**parameters**:
· sid: The security identifier (SID) of the user to wipe.

**Code Description**:
The wipe\_user method takes a SID as an argument and deletes all records associated with that user from the SQLite database. It does this by calling the wipe\_user method of the sqlite\_registry object, which in turn calls the wipe\_user method of each record type object (drive\_entry, script\_entry, file\_entry, ini\_entry, and networkshare\_entry). Each record type object then deletes all records with the given SID from its respective table in the database.

The wipe\_user method is called by the wipe\_user method of the sqlite\_registry object, which is in turn called by the wipe\_user method of the backend object. The backend object calls the wipe\_user method of the appropriate backend object (nodomain\_backend or samba\_backend) based on the type of user (machine or user).

**Note**:
- The wipe\_user method should only be called by the wipe\_user method of the sqlite\_registry object.
- The wipe\_user method should only be called after all records have been retrieved and stored in the database.
- The wipe\_user method should not be called if the user has not been authenticated.

### FunctionDef _wipe_sid(self, row_object, sid)
 **_wipe_sid**: The function of `_wipe_sid` is to delete a specified SID (Security Identifier) from a specific database table.

**parameters**:
· `row_object`: The database table object to be operated.
· `sid`: The Security Identifier (SID) to be deleted.

**Code Description**:
The function `_wipe_sid` first accesses the database session via the `db_session` attribute of the class instance (`self.db_session`). Then, it constructs a query to filter the rows in the `row_object` table that have the specified `sid`. Finally, it deletes the filtered rows and commits the transaction to the database.

This function is designed to be a private method, indicated by the single underscore prefix `_`, which is not intended to be called directly from outside the class. It is used as a helper method for other public methods in the class, such as `wipe_user`.

**Note**:
- The `row_object` parameter should be a SQLAlchemy query object that represents a database table.
- The `sid` parameter should be a string or bytes object representing a SID in the format of "S-1-5-21-...".
- The function will delete all rows with the specified `sid` in the `row_object` table. Be cautious when using this function, as it will permanently remove data from the database.
- The function automatically commits the transaction to the database after deleting the rows. Therefore, there is no need to call `commit()` again after calling this function.

In the project, `_wipe_sid` is called by the `wipe_user` method to delete a specified SID from multiple database tables related to user management. By calling `_wipe_sid` repeatedly with different table objects, `wipe_user` ensures that the SID is removed consistently across all related tables.
***
### FunctionDef wipe_hklm(self)
 **wipe\_hklm**: The function of wipe\_hklm is to delete all records in the HKLM (HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE) table of the SQLite database used in the project.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The wipe\_hklm function is a method of the sqlite\_registry class, which is defined in the gpoa/storage/sqlite\_registry.py file. It performs a delete query on all records of the samba\_preg objects in the HKLM table of the SQLite database using the db\_session object. After performing the delete operation, it calls the commit() method to save the changes to the database.

The samba\_preg objects in the HKLM table represent the entries in the Windows registry's HKLM hive. By deleting all records in the HKLM table, the function effectively wipes out all the entries in the HKLM hive of the Windows registry.

The wipe\_hklm function is called by the retrieve\_and\_store method of the nodomain\_backend and samba\_backend classes, which are defined in the gpoa/backend/nodomain\_backend.py and gpoa/backend/samba\_backend.py files, respectively. These classes are responsible for retrieving settings and storing them in the database.

In the retrieve\_and\_store method of the nodomain\_backend class, the wipe\_hklm function is called to delete all records in the HKLM table before storing new settings. In the retrieve\_and\_store method of the samba\_backend class, the wipe\_hklm function is called to delete all records in the HKLM table before storing new settings if the machine\_username is set to True.

**Note**:
The wipe\_hklm function is an internal method of the sqlite\_registry class and should not be called outside of it. It is recommended to use the provided methods of the nodomain\_backend and samba\_backend classes to interact with the SQLite database.

Here's an example of how to use the wipe\_hklm function in the retrieve\_and\_store method of the nodomain\_backend class:

```python
registry = sqlite_registry('my_database')
registry.wipe_hklm()
```

In this example, the wipe\_hklm function is called on an instance of the sqlite\_registry class, which is initialized with the name of the SQLite database. The function deletes all records in the HKLM table of the database.
