## FunctionDef machine_kinit(cache_name)
 **machine\_kinit**: The function of `machine_kinit` is to perform kinit with machine credentials using the Kerberos network authentication protocol.

**parameters**: This function has one optional parameter:
· `cache_name` (str): The name of the Kerberos ticket cache file. If not provided, a default cache file will be used.

**Code Description**:
The function `machine_kinit` performs the following steps:

1. It creates an instance of the `smbopts` class to interact with the Samba loadparm object and get properties from it. Specifically, it gets the realm and netbios name of the local machine.
2. It sets the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable to the specified cache file or a default cache file.
3. It constructs the command to be executed for kinit with machine credentials, including the realm and netbios name of the local machine.
4. It executes the kinit command using the `subprocess` module and waits for it to complete.
5. It checks the return code of the kinit command to determine if the kinit operation was successful.
6. If the kinit operation was successful, it checks if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present in the system using the `check_krb_ticket` function.
7. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the kinit operation and the presence of a Kerberos 5 ticket were successful.

The `machine_kinit` function is used in the `__init__` method of the `samba_backend` class in the `gpoa/backend/samba_backend.py` module to perform kinit with machine credentials and check if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present.

**Note**:

* The `smbopts` class should only be used to interact with the Samba loadparm object and get properties from it. It is not recommended to modify the loadparm object using this class.
* The `machine_kinit` function relies on the `kinit` command being present in the system. If the command is not present, the function will raise an exception.

**Output Example**:
```python
>>> from gpoa.util.kerberos import machine_kinit
>>> print(machine_kinit())
True
```
In this example, the `machine_kinit` function is called without any parameters. If the kinit operation is successful and a Kerberos 5 ticket is present, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
## FunctionDef machine_kdestroy(cache_name)
 **machine\_kdestroy**: The function of `machine_kdestroy` is to perform `kdestroy` for machine credentials. It securely removes the Kerberos ticket cache for the machine, which is used for authentication in a Kerberos environment.

**parameters**:
· `cache_name` (optional): The name of the Kerberos ticket cache to destroy. If not provided, the default system-wide cache will be destroyed.

**Code Description**:
1. The function first calls `get_machine_name()` to get the local machine's name.
2. It then initializes a list `kdestroy_cmd` with the command 'kdestroy'.
3. If the `cache_name` parameter is provided, the function extends the `kdestroy_cmd` list with the '-c' option and the `cache_name`.
4. The function checks if the `cache_name` is provided or if the 'KRB5CCNAME' environment variable is set. If so, it creates a subprocess to execute the `kdestroy_cmd` and waits for it to complete.
5. If the `cache_name` is provided and the corresponding cache file exists, the function removes the cache file using `os.unlink()`.
6. If the 'KRB5CCNAME' environment variable is set and the corresponding cache file exists, the function removes the cache file as well.

The `machine_kdestroy` function is used in the following scenarios in the project:
- In the `__del__` method of the `samba_backend` class in the `gpoa/backend/samba_backend.py` module, it is called when the `samba_backend` object is about to be destroyed. This ensures that any machine credentials are removed before the object is deleted.
- In the `signal_handler` function in the `gpoa/util/signals.py` module, it is called when the program receives a signal (e.g., SIGINT). This allows for graceful cleanup of machine credentials before the program exits.

**Note**:
- The `machine_kdestroy` function should be used carefully, as it removes Kerberos ticket caches. Make sure to provide the correct `cache_name` if needed, and ensure that the function is called in appropriate situations (e.g., when the program is about to exit or when a signal is received).
- The function relies on the `get_machine_name()` function to get the local machine's name. Make sure that the `get_machine_name()` function is working as expected, as incorrect machine names could lead to unexpected behavior.
- The function uses the `os.unlink()` function to remove cache files. Ensure that the current user has the necessary permissions to remove the cache files.
## FunctionDef check_krb_ticket
 **check\_krb\_ticket**): The function of `check_krb_ticket` is to check if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present in the system. It returns a boolean value based on the presence of the ticket.

**parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

The function begins by setting the `result` variable to `False`. It then attempts to execute the 'klist -s' command using `subprocess.check_call()`. If the command execution is successful, it means that a Kerberos 5 ticket is present, and the `result` variable is set to `True`.

Next, the function executes the 'klist' command using `subprocess.check_output()` to get the output of the command. The output is stored in the `output` variable. The function then logs the output using the `log()` function.

If the execution of the 'klist -s' command fails, the function catches the exception and logs it using the `log()` function.

The function returns the `result` variable, which indicates whether a Kerberos 5 ticket is present or not.

**Referenced Callers and Callees**:

The `check_krb_ticket` function is called by the `machine_kinit` function in the `gpoa/util/kerberos.py` module. The `machine_kinit` function performs a kinit with machine credentials and checks if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present using the `check_krb_ticket` function.

**Note**:

The `check_krb_ticket` function relies on the `klist` command being present in the system. If the command is not present, the function will raise an exception.

**Output Example**:

The output of the `check_krb_ticket` function is a boolean value. If a Kerberos 5 ticket is present, the output will be `True`. Otherwise, the output will be `False`.

For example, if the following code is executed:
```python
print(check_krb_ticket())
```
The output will be either `True` or `False` based on the presence of a Kerberos 5 ticket.
