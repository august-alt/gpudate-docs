## FunctionDef get_machine_name
 **get\_machine\_name**: The function of get\_machine\_name is to retrieve the localhost name looking like `DC0$`.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function `get_machine_name` is a simple wrapper function that calls the `get_machine_name` method of the `smbopts` class to get the localhost name looking like `DC0$`. The `smbopts` class is used to interact with Samba's loadparm object, which is used to read configuration files such as `smb.conf`. The `get_machine_name` method returns the localhost name looking like `DC0$` by first getting the netbios name of the local machine using the `get_netbios_name` method and then appending a `$` character to it. If the netbios name is an empty string, the function gets the hostname of the local machine using the `socket.gethostname()` function and appends a `$` character to it.

The `smbopts` class should only be used to interact with the Samba loadparm object and get properties from it. It is not recommended to modify the loadparm object using this class.

The `get_machine_name` function is used in the `gpoa/backend/nodomain_backend.py` module in the `__init__` method of the `nodomain_backend` class to get the localhost name and set it as the `machine_name` attribute of the `nodomain_backend` object. It is also used in the `gpoa/backend/samba_backend.py` module in the `__init__` method of the `samba_backend` class to get the localhost name and set it as the `machine_name` attribute of the `samba_backend` object.

**Note**: The `get_machine_name` function should only be used to retrieve the localhost name looking like `DC0$`. It is not recommended to modify the function to return a different value.

**Output Example**:
```python
>>> from gpoa.util.util import get_machine_name
>>> print(get_machine_name())
DC0$
```
## FunctionDef is_machine_name(name)
 **is\_machine\_name**: The function of is\_machine\_name is to check if the supplied username is the machine name in fact.

**parameters**:
· name: The username to be checked.

**Code Description**:
The is\_machine\_name function takes a single parameter, name, which is the username to be checked. It then compares the name with the value returned by the get\_machine\_name function. If they are the same, the function returns True, indicating that the supplied username is indeed the machine name. Otherwise, it returns False.

The get\_machine\_name function retrieves the localhost name looking like `DC0$`. It does not take any parameters and is a simple wrapper function that calls the get\_machine\_name method of the smbopts class to get the localhost name. The smbopts class is used to interact with Samba's loadparm object, which is used to read configuration files such as smb.conf. The get\_machine\_name method returns the localhost name looking like `DC0$` by first getting the netbios name of the local machine using the get\_netbios\_name method and then appending a `$` character to it. If the netbios name is an empty string, the function gets the hostname of the local machine using the `socket.gethostname()` function and appends a `$` character to it.

The is\_machine\_name function is used in the `__init__` method of the chromium\_applier, firefox\_applier, and yandex\_browser\_applier classes in the frontend section of the project. It is used to determine if the supplied username is the machine name, and if so, to set the `_is_machine_name` attribute of the class to True. This attribute is then used in the class to determine if the policies should be applied to the machine or the user.

**Note**:
The is\_machine\_name function should only be used to check if the supplied username is the machine name. It is not recommended to modify the function to return a different value.

**Output Example**:
```python
>>> from gpoa.util.util import is_machine_name
>>> print(is_machine_name('DC0$'))
True
>>> print(is_machine_name('username'))
False
```
In the above example, the is\_machine\_name function is called twice, once with the machine name `DC0$` and once with a regular user name `username`. The function returns True when the machine name is passed and False when a regular user name is passed.
## FunctionDef traverse_dir(root_dir)
 **traverse\_dir**: The function of traverse\_dir is to recursively fetch all files from a directory and its subdirectories.

**parameters**:
· root\_dir: This is the root directory that you want to start traversing from.

## FunctionDef get_homedir(username)
 **get_homedir**: The function of get_homedir is to query the password database for a user's home directory.

**parameters**:
· username (str): The username for which to retrieve the home directory.

**Code Description**:
The function `get_homedir` is a simple wrapper around the `pwd.getpwnam` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns a tuple containing information about the specified user from the password database. The `pw_dir` field of this tuple is the user's home directory. This function takes a single argument, `username`, and returns the home directory of the user with that username.

This function is used extensively throughout the project to determine the home directory of a user in various contexts. For example, it is used in the `Envvar` class in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/envvar.py` to determine the path of the environment file for a user. It is also used in the `check_target_path` function in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/file_cp.py` to check if a target path is within a user's home directory. Additionally, it is used in the `Folder` class in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/folder.py` to determine the path of a folder relative to a user's home directory.

**Note**:
It is important to note that this function relies on the password database being properly configured and up-to-date. If the password database is not properly configured, this function may return incorrect or incomplete information.

**Output Example**:
```
'/home/user'
```
This is an example of the output that this function may return, given a `username` of `'user'`. The actual output will vary depending on the specific user and the configuration of the password database.
## FunctionDef homedir_exists(username)
 **homedir\_exists**: The function of homedir\_exists is to check if the home directory exists for a specified user.

**parameters**:
· username (str): The username for which to check if the home directory exists.

**Code Description**:
The function `homedir_exists` first calls the `get_homedir` function, which is a simple wrapper around the `pwd.getpwnam` function, to retrieve the home directory of the user with the given username. It then checks if the home directory exists and is a directory. If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`, indicating that the home directory exists. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function is used in various parts of the project to determine if a user's home directory exists. For example, it is used in the `apply_shortcut` function in `gpoa/frontend/shortcut_applier.py` to check if the link destination path starts with the specification of the user's home directory. It is also used in the `Envvar` class in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/envvar.py` and the `check_target_path` function in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/file_cp.py` to determine the path of the environment file or check if the target path is within a user's home directory.

It is important to note that this function relies on the password database being properly configured and up-to-date. If the password database is not properly configured, this function may return incorrect or incomplete information.

**Note**:

* This function should only be used to check if a user's home directory exists and not for any other purpose.
* The function assumes that the `get_homedir` function is properly implemented and returns the correct home directory for a given user.
* It is important to ensure that the password database is properly configured and up-to-date before using this function.

**Output Example**:
```
True
```
This is an example of the output that this function may return, given a `username` of `'user'` and the home directory of the user exists. The actual output will vary depending on the specific user and the configuration of the password database.
## FunctionDef mk_homedir_path(username, homedir_path)
 **mk\_homedir\_path**: The function of mk\_homedir\_path is to create a subdirectory in a user's home directory specified by the given homedir\_path.

**parameters**:
· username (str): The username for which to retrieve the home directory.
· homedir\_path (str): The path of the subdirectory to be created relative to the user's home directory.

**Code Description**:
The function mk\_homedir\_path creates a subdirectory in the user's home directory by first determining the user's home directory using the get\_homedir function. It then retrieves the user's UID and GID using the pwd.getpwnam function.

The function then splits the given homedir\_path into its elements and creates each element as a subdirectory in the user's home directory using the os.makedirs function. After creating each subdirectory, it changes the ownership of the parent directory to the user using the os.chown function. This ensures that the newly created directory is owned by the user.

The function finally returns the absolute path of the last element in the homedir\_path, which is the newly created directory.

This function is useful in creating a directory structure within a user's home directory. It can be used in various contexts, such as creating a directory for storing user-specific files or configuration.

**Note**:
It is important to note that this function relies on the password database being properly configured and up-to-date. If the password database is not properly configured, this function may return incorrect or incomplete information. Additionally, this function assumes that the given homedir\_path is a valid directory path and does not contain any symbolic links or other special file types. Improper use of this function may result in unintended consequences, such as the creation of directories outside of the user's home directory or the creation of directories with incorrect ownership.
## FunctionDef runcmd(command_name)
 **runcmd**: The function of runcmd is to execute a given command and return its output and return code.

**parameters**:
· command\_name: A string representing the command to be executed.

## FunctionDef get_backends
 **get_backends**: The function of get\_backends is to get the list of backends supported by GPOA.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The function is a simple function that returns a list containing two items - 'local' and 'samba'. These two items represent the backends supported by GPOA. The function does not perform any complex operations and is used to provide a static list of backends.

The function is called in two other parts of the project - config.py and GPConfig/get\_backend in config.py. In config.py, the function is used to check if the backend specified in the configuration file is one of the backends supported by GPOA. If the backend is not in the list returned by get\_backends(), the function returns 'samba' as the default backend. In GPConfig/get\_backend in config.py, the function is called to get the list of backends supported by GPOA and to check if the backend specified in the configuration file is one of the backends in the list.

**Note**: It is important to note that the function returns a list and not a string. Therefore, when calling the function, it is necessary to use it as a list and not as a string.

**Output Example**:
```python
['local', 'samba']
```
## FunctionDef get_default_policy_name
 **get\_default\_policy\_name**: The function of get\_default\_policy\_name is to determine and return the preferred Local Policy template name based on the distribution type of ALT.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by initializing the localpolicy variable to 'workstation'. This value will be used as the default Local Policy template name if no other conditions are met.

Next, the function attempts to get the server role of the Samba object using the smbopts().get\_server\_role() method. If the server role is 'active directory domain controller', the function returns the variable dcpolicy, which is initialized to 'ad-domain-controller'.

If the above condition is not met, the function then checks if the file '/etc/altlinux-release' exists. If it does, the function reads the first line of the file and checks if it contains the word 'server' (case-insensitive). If it does, the localpolicy variable is set to 'server'.

Finally, the function returns the value of the localpolicy variable, which will be either 'workstation', 'ad-domain-controller', or 'server', depending on the conditions met.

**Referenced Objects**:

* The function calls smbopts().get\_server\_role() to get the server role of the Samba object.
* The function checks for the existence of '/etc/altlinux-release' and reads its contents.

**Use Case**:
The function is used in the GPConfig class's get\_local\_policy\_template method to return the default Local Policy template name if none is specified in the configuration file.

**Note**:

* The function does not handle exceptions, so any errors that occur while checking for the file or reading its contents will be ignored.
* The function assumes that the only possible values for the Local Policy template name are 'workstation', 'ad-domain-controller', and 'server'. If there are other possible values, the function will need to be updated accordingly.

**Output Example**:

```python
>>> get_default_policy_name()
'workstation'
```
## FunctionDef get_policy_entries(directory)
 **get\_policy\_entries**: The function of get\_policy\_entries is to get a list of directories representing "Local Policy" templates from a given directory.

**parameters**:

· directory (str): A string representing the path of the directory to be searched for "Local Policy" templates.

**Code Description**:

The function first initializes an empty list named `filtered_entries` which will store the paths of the directories representing "Local Policy" templates. It then checks if the given directory exists using `os.path.isdir(directory)`. If the directory exists, it lists all the entries (files and directories) in the directory using `os.listdir(directory)` and joins the directory path with each entry using `os.path.join(directory, entry)`.

Next, it iterates over each entry in the `entries` list. For each entry, it checks if it is a directory using `os.path.isdir(os.path.join(entry))`. If it is a directory, it further checks if it is not a symbolic link using `not os.path.islink(os.path.join(entry))`. It then checks if the name of the directory is not "default" using `not entry.rpartition('/')[2] == 'default'`. If all these conditions are satisfied, it appends the entry to the `filtered_entries` list.

Finally, it returns the `filtered_entries` list containing the paths of the directories representing "Local Policy" templates.

The `get_policy_entries` function is called by the `get_policy_variants` function in the same module `util.py`. The `get_policy_variants` function uses `get_policy_entries` to get the list of local policy variants deployed on the system. It calls `get_policy_entries` twice, once for the system policies located in `/usr/share/local-policy` and once for the user policies located in `/etc/local-policy`. It then combines both the lists and returns the combined list.

**Note**:

The `get_policy_entries` function assumes that the given directory exists and contains "Local Policy" templates. It does not handle the case where the directory does not exist or does not contain any "Local Policy" templates.

**Output Example**:

The output of the `get_policy_entries` function is a list of strings representing the paths of the directories representing "Local Policy" templates. For example, the output may look like this:

['/usr/share/local-policy/policy1', '/usr/share/local-policy/policy2', '/etc/local-policy/policy3', '/etc/local-policy/policy4']
## FunctionDef get_policy_variants
 **get\_policy\_variants**: The function of get\_policy\_variants is to retrieve a list of local policy variants deployed on the system. It does this by calling the get\_policy\_entries function twice, once for the system policies located in /usr/share/local-policy and once for the user policies located in /etc/local-policy. It then combines both the lists and returns the combined list.

**parameters**:

· None: get\_policy\_variants does not take any parameters.

## FunctionDef string_to_literal_eval(string)
 **string\_to\_literal\_eval**: This function safely evaluates a string as a Python expression and returns the result, or returns the original string if an error occurs during evaluation.

**parameters**:

· **string**: A string that contains a Python expression.

**Code Description**:

The function first attempts to evaluate the input string as a Python expression using the `ast.literal_eval()` function. If this succeeds, the resulting Python object is returned. If it fails (raising a `ValueError`), the original string is returned instead.

This function is used in the project to safely convert strings that represent Python objects (such as dictionaries or lists) into actual Python objects. It is used in particular in the `machine_apply` method of the `chromium_applier` and `yandex_browser_applier` classes, where it is used to convert string values in the `policies_json` dictionary into Python objects.

By using `ast.literal_eval()` instead of the built-in `eval()` function, `string_to_literal_eval()` avoids the security risks associated with evaluating arbitrary Python code.

**Note**:

This function should only be used with strings that contain Python expressions that are known to be safe. In particular, it should not be used with strings that contain arbitrary user input, as this could lead to security vulnerabilities.

**Output Example**:

Given the input string `'{"foo": 1, "bar": [2, 3]}'`, the function would return a Python dictionary with keys `'foo'` and `'bar'`, where `'foo'` maps to the integer `1` and `'bar'` maps to a list containing the integers `2` and `3`. If given the input string `'not a valid python expression'`, the function would return the original string unchanged.
