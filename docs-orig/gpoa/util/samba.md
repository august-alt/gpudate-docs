## ClassDef smbopts
 **smbopts**: The function of smbopts is to provide a way to interact with Samba's loadparm object, which is used to read configuration files such as `smb.conf`. It also provides methods to get properties from the loadparm object.

**attributes**:
· `prog`: A string that represents the name of the program. It is used as the prog option in the `optparse.OptionParser` constructor.

**Code Description**:
The `smbopts` class is defined with several methods that interact with the Samba loadparm object. In the `__init__` method, an `optparse.OptionParser` object and a `options.SambaOptions` object are created. The `options.SambaOptions` object is used to get the loadparm object, which is stored in the `lp` attribute.

The `get_realm` method returns the default realm specified in the `smb.conf` file. The `get_cache_dir` method returns the cache directory specified in the `smb.conf` file. The `get_server_role` method returns the server role specified in the `smb.conf` file. The `get_machine_name` method returns the localhost name looking like `DC0$`. The `get_netbios_name` method returns the netbios name specified in the `smb.conf` file. The `_get_prop` method is a private method that returns the value of a property from the loadparm object.

The `smbopts` class is used in the `gpoa/util/kerberos.py` module in the `machine_kinit` function to get the realm and netbios name of the local machine. It is also used in the `gpoa/util/util.py` module in the `get_machine_name` function to get the localhost name. Additionally, it is used in the `gpoa/util/windows.py` module in the `smbcreds` class to get the loadparm object and set the domain controller for the class.

**Note**:
The `smbopts` class should only be used to interact with the Samba loadparm object and get properties from it. It is not recommended to modify the loadparm object using this class.

**Output Example**:
```python
opts = smbopts()
print(opts.get_realm())
print(opts.get_cache_dir())
print(opts.get_server_role())
print(opts.get_machine_name())
print(opts.get_netbios_name())
```
This will output the default realm, cache directory, server role, localhost name, and netbios name specified in the `smb.conf` file.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, prog)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Smbopts object.

**parameters**:
· prog: This is an optional parameter, which is a string that specifies the name of the program. If not provided, the name of the program will be determined by the system.

**Code Description**:
The first line of the code creates an instance of the OptionParser class, which is used to parse command-line options. The prog argument is used to specify the name of the program, which is used in the help output.

The second line creates an instance of the SambaOptions class, which is a user-defined class that handles the parsing of Samba-specific command-line options. The instance is created with the parser object as its argument, which allows the SambaOptions class to add its own options to the parser.

The third line calls the get\_loadparm() method of the SambaOptions instance, which returns a LoadParm object. This object is stored in the lp attribute and can be used to access the parsed options.

**Note**:
- The prog argument in the __init__ method is optional, but it is recommended to provide a value for it to make the help output more clear and informative.
- The SambaOptions class should have been defined before the Smbopts class, and it should have the get\_loadparm() method.
- The LoadParm object returned by the get\_loadparm() method should have the necessary options and values set, which can be used for further processing.

It is important to note that this code is just initializing the object and setting up the option parser, it doesn't actually parse any options yet. The parsing of options is usually done in a separate method, which is called after the object is initialized.

### FunctionDef get_realm(self)
 **get\_realm**: The function of `get_realm` is to retrieve the default realm specified in the Samba configuration file (smb.conf).

**parameters**:
· `self`: The object instance that `get_realm` is called upon. This parameter is a reference to the Samba object and is used to access the Samba object's properties dictionary (`self.lp`).

***
### FunctionDef get_cache_dir(self)
 **get\_cache\_dir**: The function of get\_cache\_dir is to retrieve the 'cache directory' property value from the Samba object's properties dictionary using the internal \_get\_prop function.

**parameters**:
· `self`: The Samba object instance. This is required to access the Samba object's properties dictionary.

***
### FunctionDef get_server_role(self)
 **get\_server\_role**: The function of `get_server_role` is to retrieve the 'server role' property value from the Samba object's properties dictionary.

**parameters**:
· `self`: The Samba object instance. This object contains the properties dictionary that holds the Samba server's configuration properties.

***
### FunctionDef get_machine_name(self)
 **get_machine_name**: The function of `get_machine_name` is to retrieve the machine name in the format of "DC0$".

**parameters**:
· `self`: The Samba object instance. This object contains the properties dictionary that holds the Samba configuration data.

**Code Description**:
The `get_machine_name` function first calls the `get_netbios_name` function, which is a method of the Samba object and retrieves the 'netbios name' property value from the Samba object's properties dictionary. If the 'netbios name' is not set, the function uses the `socket.gethostname()` method to get the current hostname and takes the portion before the first dot as the machine name. The machine name is then appended with a "$" character to match the required format.

The `get_machine_name` function is a useful utility for obtaining the machine name in the format required by Samba. It can be used in conjunction with other Samba configuration functions to ensure that the Samba service is correctly configured for the local machine.

**Note**:
The `get_machine_name` function assumes that the Samba object has been correctly initialized and contains a valid properties dictionary. If the `get_netbios_name` function returns an empty string, the function will still return a valid machine name, but it may not match the actual netbios name of the machine.

**Output Example**:
A possible return value of the `get_machine_name` function is "DC0$" if the 'netbios name' property is set to "DC0" in the Samba object's properties dictionary. If the 'netbios name' property is not set, the function will return the machine's hostname in the format of "HOSTNAME$".
***
### FunctionDef get_netbios_name(self)
 **get\_netbios\_name**: The function of `get_netbios_name` is to retrieve the 'netbios name' property value from the Samba object's properties dictionary.

**parameters**:
· `self`: The Samba object instance. This object contains the properties dictionary that holds the Samba configuration data.

***
### FunctionDef _get_prop(self, property_name)
 **`_get_prop`**: The function of `_get_prop` is to retrieve the property value from the Samba object's properties dictionary.

**parameters**:
· `property_name` (str): The name of the property to be retrieved from the Samba object's properties dictionary.

**Code Description**:
The `_get_prop` function takes a single parameter, `property_name`, which is a string representing the name of the property to be retrieved. It then returns the value of the property with the given name from the Samba object's properties dictionary (`self.lp`).

This function is used internally by other methods in the Samba object to retrieve specific properties from the `self.lp` dictionary. By encapsulating the retrieval of properties within this function, it allows for a more maintainable and organized codebase.

For example, when calling `self._get_prop('realm')`, the function will return the value associated with the 'realm' key in the `self.lp` dictionary.

**Note**:
- The `property_name` parameter should always be a string representing a valid key in the `self.lp` dictionary.
- The `_get_prop` function is intended for internal use within the Samba object and should not be called directly by external code.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the `self.lp` dictionary contains the following data:
```python
{
    'realm': 'EXAMPLE.COM',
    'cache directory': '/var/cache/samba',
    'server role': 'active directory domain controller',
    'netbios name': 'EXAMPLE'
}
```
A call to `self._get_prop('realm')` would return the string 'EXAMPLE.COM', while a call to `self._get_prop('cache directory')` would return the string '/var/cache/samba'.
