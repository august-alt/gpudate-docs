## ClassDef encoder
 **encoder**: The encoder class is used to encode various data types into a JSON format, with specific handling for set and unicode objects.

**Attributes**:

* `obj`: The object to be encoded.

**Code Description**:

The encoder class is a subclass of json.JSONEncoder, which means it inherits all the methods and attributes from the JSONEncoder class. The class overrides the `default` method to provide custom encoding behavior for certain data types.

The `default` method takes an object as an argument and returns a JSON-serializable object. If the input object is a set, the method converts it to a tuple before returning. This is necessary because the JSON format does not support sets natively.

If the input object is a unicode string, the method encodes it using the 'unicode_escape' encoding and then decodes it as an ASCII string. This ensures that any special characters in the string are properly escaped, making the resulting JSON string valid and safe for transmission.

The `result = super(encoder, self)` line is used to call the parent class's `default` method and get the initial encoding result. This allows the encoder to handle any data types that are already JSON-serializable without any additional processing.

**Note**:

* The encoder class is designed to handle specific data types, such as sets and unicode strings, that are not natively supported by the JSON format. If you need to encode other data types, you may need to modify the `default` method or create additional subclasses.
* The encoder class does not handle recursive data structures or circular references. If you need to encode such structures, consider using a different JSON library or implementing a custom encoder that can handle these cases.

**Output Example**:

Suppose we have the following data structure:
```python
data = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "hobbies": {"reading", "swimming", "coding"}}
```
We can use the encoder class to encode this data into a JSON string as follows:
```python
encoder = encoder()
json_data = json.dumps(data, cls=encoder.encoder)
print(json_data)
```
The resulting JSON string will be:
```json
{"name": "John", "age": 30, "hobbies": ["reading", "swimming", "coding"]}
```
Note that the set `{"reading", "swimming", "coding"}` has been converted to a list `["reading", "swimming", "coding"]` in the resulting JSON string.
### FunctionDef default(self, obj)
 **default**: The function of default is to encode and convert the input object into a different format based on certain conditions.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the class to which the method belongs.
· obj: The object to be encoded.

**Code Description**:
The function first calls the default method of its parent class encoder using the `super()` function and assigns the result to the variable `result`. This is the initial encoding of the input object.

Next, the function checks if the input object is an instance of the built-in type `set`. If it is, the function converts the set to a tuple and assigns the result back to the `result` variable. This is because sets are unordered and unhashable collections, while tuples are ordered and hashable collections.

Then, the function checks if the input object is an instance of the built-in type `unicode`. If it is, the function encodes the unicode string to 'unicode\_escape' and then decodes it to 'ascii' using the `encode()` and `decode()` methods, respectively. This is because unicode strings can contain characters that are not representable in ASCII, and this conversion ensures that the resulting string only contains ASCII characters.

Finally, the function returns the `result` variable, which contains the encoded object.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the input object is either a set or a unicode string. If the object is of a different type, the function will still return the initial encoding of the object.
- The function does not modify the original object, but instead returns a new encoded object.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the input object is a set containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'. The output of the function would be a tuple containing the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c':
```python
>>> obj = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
>>> encoded_obj = default(obj)
>>> encoded_obj
('a', 'b', 'c')
```
Suppose the input object is a unicode string containing the character 'é'. The output of the function would be an ASCII string containing the character '\xe9':
```python
>>> obj = u'é'
>>> encoded_obj = default(obj)
>>> encoded_obj
'\xe9'
```

## ClassDef slogm
 **slogm**: The slogm class is used to create structured log messages that include a timestamp, a message, and a dictionary of keyword arguments.

**attributes**:
· message: A string representing the log message.
· kwargs: A dictionary of keyword arguments to include in the log message.

**Code Description**:
The slogm class is a custom logging class that formats messages with a timestamp, a message, and keyword arguments. When a slogm object is created, it takes in a message string and an optional dictionary of keyword arguments. If no keyword arguments are provided, an empty dictionary is used.

The **\_\_str\_\_** method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of the slogm object. It first gets the current date and time as an ISO formatted string with millisecond precision. Then, it creates a new dictionary that combines the keyword arguments provided to the slogm object with any additional keyword arguments passed to the **\_\_str\_\_** method. Finally, it returns a string that includes the timestamp, message, and keyword arguments, separated by vertical bars.

The slogm class is used extensively throughout the project for logging purposes. It is used in the backend, frontend, and plugin modules to log informational, warning, and error messages. By using a custom logging class, the project is able to maintain consistent formatting and presentation of log messages throughout.

**Note**:
When creating a slogm object, it is important to include any relevant keyword arguments in the kwargs parameter. These arguments will be included in the log message and can provide additional context for debugging and troubleshooting.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of a slogm object and its string representation:
```python
log_msg = slogm("This is a log message", {"user": "jdoe", "status": "success"})
print(str(log_msg))
# Output: 2023-03-14T12:34:56.789|This is a log message|{'user': 'jdoe', 'status': 'success'}
```
In this example, the slogm object is created with a message string and a dictionary of keyword arguments. The string representation of the object includes the current date and time, the message string, and the keyword arguments.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message, kwargs)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object of the slogm module with a message and keyword arguments.

**parameters**:
· message: A required parameter that specifies the message to be logged. It can be a string, integer, or any other serializable object.
· kwargs: An optional parameter that specifies the keyword arguments to be passed to the logging function. If not provided, an empty dictionary is used as the default value.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the object of the slogm module with a message and keyword arguments. It first assigns the message and kwargs parameters to the object's message and kwargs attributes, respectively. Then, it checks if the kwargs attribute is empty or not. If it is empty, an empty dictionary is assigned to the kwargs attribute.

The purpose of this check is to ensure that the kwargs attribute always has a dictionary object, even if no keyword arguments are provided. This can simplify the code that uses the slogm object, as it can always rely on the kwargs attribute to be a dictionary.

Here's an example of how to use the __init__ function:
```python
logger = slogm.Slogm('Hello, world!')
```
In this example, a new slogm object is created with the message 'Hello, world!'. Since no keyword arguments are provided, an empty dictionary is assigned to the kwargs attribute.

**Note**:
The slogm module is designed to provide a simple and flexible logging interface for the GPOA project. The __init__ function is the entry point for creating a new logging object, and it allows users to specify the message and keyword arguments to be logged.

When using the __init__ function, it is important to provide a valid message object that can be serialized and logged. Additionally, users can provide any number of keyword arguments to be passed to the logging function. These arguments can be used to customize the logging behavior, such as setting the log level, specifying the log destination, or formatting the log message.

Overall, the __init__ function provides a simple and flexible way to initialize a logging object in the GPOA project. By specifying the message and keyword arguments, users can customize the logging behavior to meet their specific needs.

### FunctionDef __str__(self)
 **`__str__`**: The function of `__str__` is to return a human-readable representation of an instance of the `slogm` class.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

The `__str__` function is a special method in Python that is called when the `str()` function is called on an instance of a class. In this case, the `__str__` function is a method of the `slogm` class, which is used for logging purposes.

When the `__str__` function is called, it first gets the current date and time in ISO 8601 format with millisecond precision using the `datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(sep=' ', timespec='milliseconds')` method and assigns it to the `now` variable.

Next, it creates an empty dictionary `args` and updates it with the keyword arguments `self.kwargs` of the instance of the `slogm` class. This allows for any keyword arguments passed to the `slogm` class constructor to be included in the log message.

Then, it concatenates the `now`, `self.message`, and `args` variables into a single string using the `'{}|{}|{}'` format string. The `self.message` variable is a message passed to the `slogm` class constructor.

Finally, it returns the resulting string, which can be used as a human-readable log message.

**Note**:

* The `__str__` function is typically used for logging and debugging purposes, as it allows for a human-readable representation of an instance of a class.
* The `args` dictionary is used to include any keyword arguments passed to the `slogm` class constructor in the log message.

**Output Example**:

Assuming an instance of the `slogm` class is created with the message "Test log message" and keyword arguments `{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`, the output of the `__str__` function would be:

`2023-03-14 15:26:56.123|Test log message|{'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}`

## FunctionDef log(message_code, data)
 **check\_krb\_ticket**: The function of check\_krb\_ticket is to check if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present.

**parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

The function first tries to execute the 'klist -s' command using subprocess.check\_call(). If the command execution is successful, it means that a Kerberos 5 ticket is present. The function then executes the 'klist' command using subprocess.check\_output() to get the output of the command. The output is stored in the 'output' variable. The function then logs the output using the log() function.

If the execution of the 'klist -s' command fails, the function catches the exception and logs it using the log() function.

**Note**: None

**Output Example**:

The output of the 'klist' command is logged using the log() function. Here is an example output:

Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc\_1000

Default principal: user@EXAMPLE.COM

**check\_krb\_ticket\_present**: The function of check\_krb\_ticket\_present is to check if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present.

**parameters**: None

**Code Description**:

The function calls the check\_krb\_ticket() function to check if a Kerberos 5 ticket is present. If the check\_krb\_ticket() function returns True, it means that a Kerberos 5 ticket is present and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

**Note**: None

**Output Example**:

True or False based on the presence of a Kerberos 5 ticket.

**get\_sid**: The function of get\_sid is to lookup a SID not only using wbinfo or sssd but also using its own cache.

**parameters**:

· domain: The domain of the user.

· username: The username of the user.

· is\_machine: A boolean value indicating whether the user is a machine or not.

**Code Description**:

The function first initializes the 'sid' variable to 'local-{}'.format(username). This is the SID for a local user.

If the 'domain' parameter is not provided, it means that the user is a local user. In this case, the function gets the UID of the user using pwd.getpwnam(username). If the 'is\_machine' parameter is False, the UID is used to create the SID. Otherwise, the UID is set to 0.

If the 'domain' parameter is provided, the function tries to get the SID of the user using wbinfo\_getsid(domain, username). If this fails, the function logs the exception using the log() function and returns the initialized 'sid' variable.

The function then logs the 'sid' variable using the log() function and returns it.

**Note**: None

**Output Example**:

The SID of the user in the format 'DOMAIN-S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234'.

**load\_xml\_preg**: The function of load\_xml\_preg is to parse an XML/PReg file and return its preg object.

**parameters**:

· xml\_path: The path to the XML/PReg file.

**Code Description**:

The function first logs the 'xml\_path' parameter using the log() function. It then creates a GPPolParser object and parses the XML/PReg file using the ElementTree library. The parsed XML/PReg file is loaded into the GPPolParser object using the load\_xml() function.

The GPPolParser object is then used to get the preg object of the XML/PReg file using the pol\_file attribute. The preg object is returned by the function.

**Note**: None

**Output Example**:

The preg object of the XML/PReg file.

**load\_
