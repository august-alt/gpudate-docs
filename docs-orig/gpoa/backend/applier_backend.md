## ClassDef applier_backend
 **applier\_backend**: The function of applier\_backend is to serve as a base class for different types of backend implementations that handle the retrieval and storage of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) settings in a unified manner.

**attributes**:
Â· `retrieve_and_store`: A class method responsible for retrieving GPO settings and storing them in a database.

**Code Description**:
The `applier_backend` class, as an abstract base class (ABC), defines a template for its derived classes to implement specific backend functionalities. It has a single class method, `retrieve_and_store`, which is intended to be implemented by derived classes to handle the retrieval and storage of GPO settings.

In the given code, the `retrieve_and_store` method is empty, and derived classes like `freeipa_backend`, `nodomain_backend`, and `samba_backend` provide their own implementation. This emphasizes the role of `applier_backend` as a base class that sets a standard for handling GPO settings while allowing customization based on the specific backend requirements.

**Relationship with derived classes**:
- `freeipa_backend`: This class inherits from `applier_backend` and implements the `retrieve_and_store` method to handle GPO settings in FreeIPA environments.
- `nodomain_backend`: This class also inherits from `applier_backend` and implements the `retrieve_and_store` method to manage GPO settings in non-domain environments.
- `samba_backend`: This class inherits from `applier_backend` and implements the `retrieve_and_store` method to deal with GPO settings in Samba environments.

**Note**:
- The `applier_backend` class is an abstract base class, and it is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, create instances of its derived classes (e.g., `freeipa_backend`, `nodomain_backend`, and `samba_backend`) to handle GPO settings in specific environments.
- The `retrieve_and_store` method should be implemented in derived classes to provide the actual logic for retrieving and storing GPO settings.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the applier\_backend object.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a special method in Python classes, which is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class. In this case, the __init__ function is defined in the applier\_backend class, and it does not take any parameters. When a new object of the applier\_backend class is created, the __init__ function is called to initialize the object. Since no initialization is required in this case, the function simply contains a pass statement.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function is called automatically when an object is created, so there is no need to call it explicitly.
- If there are any attributes that need to be initialized, they should be defined and initialized in the __init__ function.
- The __init__ function can take parameters, which can be used to initialize the attributes of the class. If the __init__ function takes parameters, they must be passed when creating an object of the class.

### FunctionDef retrieve_and_store(self)
 **retrieve_and_store**: The function of retrieve\_and\_store is to retrieve data and store it. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The retrieve\_and\_store function is a member function of the applier\_backend class, which is defined in the applier\_backend.py module. As the name suggests, this function is responsible for retrieving data and storing it. However, the current implementation of this function is a pass statement, which means it does not contain any code to perform the intended functionality.

Here's the code for the function:
```python
def retrieve_and_store(self):
    pass
```
As we can see, the function takes a single parameter, `self`, which is a reference to the instance of the class. However, it does not perform any operations on this parameter.

**Note**:

* This function currently does not perform any operations and is a placeholder for future implementation.
* Developers who wish to use this function should implement the necessary code to retrieve and store data within the function.
* It is essential to ensure that the function is tested thoroughly to ensure that it performs the intended operations correctly.
* Proper error handling should be implemented to handle any exceptions that may occur during the retrieval and storage of data.
