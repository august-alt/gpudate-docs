## FunctionDef read_tasks(filename)
 **read\_tasks**: The function of read\_tasks is to read tasks from a specified filename.

**parameters**:
· filename: A string representing the name of the file to be read.

**Code Description**:
The read\_tasks function takes in one argument, filename, which is a string representing the name of the file to be read. The function does not contain any implementation details, and it is up to the developer to define the functionality of reading tasks from a file.

From the project hierarchy, we can see that this function is used in the pref\_parsers function in gpoa/gpt/gpt.py. In pref\_parsers, read\_tasks is assigned to the FileType.SCHEDULDTASKS key of the parsers dictionary. This indicates that when the FileType.SCHEDULDTASKS key is encountered in the pref\_parsers function, the read\_tasks function will be called to read tasks from a file.

Therefore, it is essential to implement the read\_tasks function to read tasks from a file correctly. The implementation details will depend on the format of the file and the tasks contained within it.

**Note**:

* Ensure that the filename argument passed to the read\_tasks function is a valid file path.
* Implement the read\_tasks function to read tasks from the specified file correctly.
* The implementation details of the read\_tasks function will depend on the format of the file and the tasks contained within it.
* Proper error handling should be implemented to handle any exceptions that may occur during the file reading process.
## FunctionDef merge_tasks(storage, sid, task_objects, policy_name)
 **merge\_tasks**: The function of merge\_tasks is to merge a list of task objects based on a given policy name in the storage system.

**parameters**:
· `storage`: An object that provides an interface to access and manipulate the storage system where the tasks are stored.
· `sid`: A unique identifier for the storage system where the tasks are stored.
· `task_objects`: A list of task objects to be merged.
· `policy_name`: The name of the policy to be applied during the merge process.

**Code Description**:
The function `merge_tasks` takes in four parameters: `storage`, `sid`, `task_objects`, and `policy_name`. The function iterates over each task object in `task_objects` and performs a merge operation based on the given `policy_name` in the `storage` system identified by `sid`.

The function does not contain any implementation details, and it is likely that the actual merge operation is implemented elsewhere and is being called here. The `pass` statement in the loop body is a placeholder indicating that no action is being taken in this function.

From a functional perspective, this function serves as a bridge between the `pref_mergers` module and the actual merge operation. The `pref_mergers` module defines a dictionary of merger functions for different file types, including `FileType.SCHEDULEDTASKS`, which is mapped to `merge_tasks`. When the `pref_mergers` module is called to merge tasks, it returns a dictionary of merger functions, and the appropriate function is called based on the file type.

**Note**:
This function is a placeholder and does not contain any implementation details. The actual merge operation is likely implemented elsewhere and is being called here. When using this function, make sure to provide a valid `storage` object, a unique `sid`, a list of `task_objects` to be merged, and a valid `policy_name` to be applied during the merge process.
