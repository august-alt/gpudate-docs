## FunctionDef read_files(filesxml)
 **read\_files**: The function of read\_files is to read a list of files from an XML file and return a list of file entry objects, each with its properties set based on the XML data.

**parameters**:
· filesxml: A string representing the path to the XML file containing the file data.

**Code Description**:
The read\_files function begins by creating an empty list called files to store the file entry objects. It then iterates over each file element in the XML file using a for loop. For each file element, it creates a new file entry object using the file entry constructor and the 'fromPath' property of the file element. It then sets the properties of the file entry object using the setter methods and the corresponding properties of the file element. These properties include the action, target path, read-only, archive, hidden, suppress, and executable attributes. The function then appends the file entry object to the files list. Finally, the function returns the files list.

From a functional perspective, the read\_files function is called in the pref\_parsers function of the gpoa/gpt/gpt.py/pref\_parsers object. The pref\_parsers function returns a dictionary of file type constants as keys and corresponding file reader functions as values. The read\_files function is the value associated with the FileType.FILES constant. When the pref\_parsers function is called with FileType.FILES as the argument, it returns the read\_files function, which is then called to read the list of files from the XML file and return the file entry objects.

**Note**:
- The read\_files function assumes that the XML file is well-formed and contains valid file data. If the XML file is invalid or missing required properties, the function may raise an exception.
- The read\_files function sets the default value of the properties to None if they are missing from the XML file.
- The read\_files function is only intended to be called by the pref\_parsers function and should not be called directly.

**Output Example**:
Suppose we have an XML file named "files.xml" with the following contents:
```xml
<files>
  <file>
    <Properties>
      <property name="fromPath" value="C:\example\file1.txt" />
      <property name="action" value="C" />
      <property name="targetPath" value="D:\example\file1.txt" />
      <property name="readOnly" value="true" />
      <property name="archive" value="false" />
      <property name="hidden" value="false" />
      <property name="suppress" value="false" />
      <property name="executable" value="true" />
    </Properties>
  </file>
  <file>
    <Properties>
      <property name="fromPath" value="C:\example\file2.txt" />
      <property name="action" value="M" />
      <property name="targetPath" value="D:\example\file2.txt" />
      <property name="readOnly" value="false" />
      <property name="archive" value="true" />
      <property name="hidden" value="true" />
      <property name="suppress" value="true" />
      <property name="executable" value="false" />
    </Properties>
  </file>
</files>
```
Calling the read\_files function with the path to this file as its parameter would return the following list:
```python
[
  fileentry('C:\\example\\file1.txt', action='C', targetPath='D:\\example\\file1.txt', readOnly=True, archive=False, hidden=False, suppress=False, executable=True),
  fileentry('C:\\example\\file2.txt', action='M', targetPath='D:\\example\\file2.txt', readOnly=False, archive=True, hidden=True, suppress=True, executable=False)
]
```
This list contains two file entry objects, each with its properties set based on the XML data.
## FunctionDef merge_files(storage, sid, file_objects, policy_name)
 **merge\_files**: The function of merge\_files is to add a list of file objects to a specified storage with a given policy name for each file object.

**parameters**:
· storage: An object that has the method add\_file to add files.
· sid: A unique identifier for the storage.
· file\_objects: A list of file objects to be added to the storage.
· policy\_name: A name of the policy to be applied to the files.

**Code Description**:
The function iterates over the file\_objects list and for each file object, it calls the add\_file method of the storage object with the sid, file object and policy\_name as parameters. This way, it adds all the files in the file\_objects list to the storage with the specified policy name.

This function is used in the pref\_mergers function of the gpoa/gpt/gpt.py file. The pref\_mergers function returns a dictionary where the keys are different types of files and the values are functions that merge files of that type. The merge\_files function is assigned as the value for the FILES key, which means that it is used to merge files of type FILES.

**Note**:
- The sid, file\_objects and policy\_name parameters should be valid and non-empty.
- The storage object should have the method add\_file and it should be working correctly.
- The function does not return any value, it only adds files to the storage.
- The order of the files in the file\_objects list is preserved, so the files will be added to the storage in the same order.
- The function does not check for duplicates, so if there are any duplicates in the file\_objects list, they will be added to the storage multiple times.
- The function does not validate the policy\_name, so it should be a valid policy name that is accepted by the storage object.
- The function does not check if the files were added successfully, so it should be handled by the caller if necessary.
## ClassDef fileentry
 **fileentry** : The `fileentry` class is used to manage and configure file properties for various operations such as reading files.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are as follows:
· `fromPath`: This is a parameter that represents the source path of the file.
· `action`: This parameter is used to set the action to be performed on the file, with a default value of 'C' (Copy).
· `targetPath`: This parameter is used to set the target path of the file for operations like moving or copying.
· `readOnly`: This parameter is used to set the read-only attribute of the file.
· `archive`: This parameter is used to set the archive attribute of the file.
· `hidden`: This parameter is used to set the hidden attribute of the file.
· `suppress`: This parameter is used to set the suppress attribute of the file.
· `executable`: This parameter is used to set the executable attribute of the file.

**Code Description**: The `fileentry` class has an initializer method `__init__` that takes a single parameter `fromPath`, which is used to initialize the source path of the file. Various setter methods are provided to set different file properties like action, target path, read-only, archive, hidden, suppress, and executable.

The `fileentry` class is used in the `read_files` function defined in the `gpoa/gpt/files.py/read_files` module. The `read_files` function reads an XML file containing information about multiple files and creates a list of `fileentry` objects for each file. The `fileentry` objects are initialized with the `fromPath` parameter, and other file properties are set using the corresponding setter methods.

**Note**: When creating a `fileentry` object, it is mandatory to provide the source path of the file using the `fromPath` parameter. Other parameters like action, target path, read-only, archive, hidden, suppress, and executable are optional and can be set using the corresponding setter methods. When creating a `fileentry` object in the `read_files` function, the `fromPath` parameter is obtained from the XML file, and other file properties are set to default values if not provided in the XML file.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, fromPath)
 **`__init__`**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize the fileentry object with a given path.

**parameters**:
· `fromPath`: A string representing the path of the file that this fileentry object will represent.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` function is a special method in Python classes, called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.

In this specific implementation, the `__init__` function takes one argument, `fromPath`, which is the path of the file that the fileentry object will represent. This path is stored in the `fromPath` attribute of the object, for future use.

**Note**:
- The `fromPath` argument is required and must be a string.
- The `fromPath` argument should be an existing file path, otherwise, subsequent operations on the fileentry object may fail.
- This `__init__` function does not perform any validation or error checking on the `fromPath` argument. It is the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the argument is valid.
- The `fromPath` attribute is a public attribute and can be accessed directly from outside the object. However, it is recommended to use the object's methods to manipulate the attribute, for better encapsulation and code readability.
***
### FunctionDef set_action(self, action)
 **set\_action**: The function of set\_action is to set the action attribute of a fileentry object.

**parameters**:
· action: A string that represents the action to be performed on the file.

***
### FunctionDef set_target_path(self, targetPath)
 **set\_target\_path**): The function of set\_target\_path is to set the target path for a file object.

**parameters**):
· targetPath: The target path for the file object.

***
### FunctionDef set_read_only(self, readOnly)
 **set\_read\_only**): The function of set\_read\_only is to set the read-only attribute of a file object.

**parameters**):
· readOnly: A boolean value indicating whether the file should be read-only (True) or not (False).

**Code Description**):
The set\_read\_only function is a simple method that sets the value of the readOnly attribute of the file object to the input parameter. It takes one argument, readOnly, which is a boolean value that determines whether the file should be read-only or not.

In the code, the function is called in the read\_files function, which is used to read files from an XML file and create file objects for each file. The set\_read\_only function is called to set the read-only attribute of the file object based on the value of the 'readOnly' attribute in the XML file. If the 'readOnly' attribute is not present in the XML file, the readOnly attribute of the file object is not changed.

Here's an example of how the set\_read\_only function is called in the read\_files function:
```python
fil_obj.set_read_only(props.get('readOnly', default=None))
```
In this example, the get method is used to retrieve the value of the 'readOnly' attribute from the XML file. If the 'readOnly' attribute is not present, the default value of None is used. The set\_read\_only function is then called with the retrieved value as the argument.

**Note**):
It is important to note that the set\_read\_only function only sets the read-only attribute of the file object. It does not actually make the file read-only on the file system. To make the file read-only on the file system, additional code would be required to modify the file permissions.

Additionally, it is important to ensure that the input parameter to the set\_read\_only function is a boolean value. Passing a non-boolean value may result in unexpected behavior.

Finally, it is important to note that the set\_read\_only function is only called in the read\_files function. If the set\_read\_only function is needed in other parts of the code, it should be called explicitly.
***
### FunctionDef set_archive(self, archive)
 **set\_archive**: The function of set\_archive is to set the archive attribute of a fileentry object.

**parameters**:
· archive: The value that will be assigned to the archive attribute of the fileentry object.

**Code Description**:
The set\_archive function is a method that belongs to the fileentry class, and it is used to set the value of the archive attribute of a fileentry object. It takes one parameter, archive, which is the value that will be assigned to the archive attribute.

In the body of the function, the first line is "self.archive = archive", which assigns the value of the archive parameter to the archive attribute of the fileentry object.

From a functional perspective, the set\_archive function is called in the read\_files function, which is located in the gpoa/gpt/files.py/read\_files object. The read\_files function reads an XML file that contains information about files, such as their properties and actions. For each file in the XML file, the read\_files function creates a fileentry object and sets its attributes based on the information in the XML file. One of the attributes that is set is the archive attribute, which is set using the set\_archive function.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the set\_archive function is a method that belongs to the fileentry class, and it can only be called on fileentry objects. Additionally, the archive parameter is optional, and if it is not provided, the archive attribute of the fileentry object will not be changed.
***
### FunctionDef set_hidden(self, hidden)
 **set\_hidden**: The function of set\_hidden is to set the value of the hidden attribute of a fileentry object.

**parameters**:
· hidden: The value to be set for the hidden attribute. This can be of any data type.

**Code Description**:
The set\_hidden function is a simple assignment function that sets the value of the hidden attribute of the fileentry object to the value of the hidden parameter. It takes one parameter, hidden, and assigns its value to the hidden attribute of the fileentry object.

This function is used in the read\_files function of the gpoa/gpt/files.py/read\_files object to set the hidden attribute of the fileentry object being created. By passing the value of the 'hidden' property of the XML element to the set\_hidden function, the hidden attribute of the fileentry object is set accordingly.

**Note**:
- The hidden parameter can be of any data type, and its value will be assigned to the hidden attribute of the fileentry object without any conversion or validation.
- The set\_hidden function is only used to set the hidden attribute of a fileentry object and does not perform any other operations.
- The set\_hidden function is called in the context of creating a fileentry object, and its value is used to configure the object's hidden attribute.
- The set\_hidden function is not intended to be used outside of the fileentry object and should only be called as a method of that object.
- The set\_hidden function is a simple assignment function and does not perform any error checking or validation on the hidden parameter. It is the responsibility of the calling function to ensure that the hidden parameter is valid and appropriate for the fileentry object.
***
### FunctionDef set_suppress(self, suppress)
 **set\_suppress**: The function of set\_suppress is to set the value of the suppress attribute of a fileentry object.

**parameters**:
· suppress: The value that will be assigned to the suppress attribute of the fileentry object.

**Code Description**:
The set\_suppress function is a method of the fileentry class, which is defined in the files.py module. This function is used to set the value of the suppress attribute of a fileentry object. The suppress attribute is used to determine whether a file or directory should be suppressed during a file management operation.

The function takes one parameter, suppress, which is the value that will be assigned to the suppress attribute. If no argument is passed, the default value is None.

The function begins by setting the value of the suppress attribute to the value of the suppress parameter.

This function is used in the read\_files function of the same module, where it is used to set the suppress attribute of a fileentry object based on the value of the 'suppress' tag in an XML file.

**Note**:
- The set\_suppress function is only used to set the value of the suppress attribute of a fileentry object. It does not perform any other operations.
- The suppress attribute is used to determine whether a file or directory should be suppressed during a file management operation. If the suppress attribute is set to True, the file or directory will not be processed during the file management operation.
- The set\_suppress function is only called within the files.py module, specifically in the read\_files function. It is not intended to be called by external code.
- The set\_suppress function is a simple function, it only set the value of the suppress attribute, it does not have any return value.
- The set\_suppress function is case-sensitive, it only accept the exact parameter name 'suppress' to set the attribute value.
- The set\_suppress function is a part of the object-oriented programming concept, it can only be used after the fileentry object is created.
***
### FunctionDef set_executable(self, executable)
 **set\_executable**: The function of set\_executable is to set the executable status of a file object.

**parameters**:
· **executable**: A boolean value indicating whether the file should be executable or not.

**Code Description**:
The set\_executable function is a method of the fileentry class, which is used to set the executable attribute of the file object. It takes one parameter, executable, which is a boolean value that determines whether the file should be executable or not. If the value is True, the file is set as executable, otherwise, it is not.

In the code, the function is called in the read\_files function, which is used to read a list of files from an XML file and return a list of file objects. The set\_executable function is called to set the executable attribute of each file object based on the 'executable' property of the corresponding XML element.

**Note**:
- The set\_executable function should only be called on file object instances of the fileentry class.
- The executable parameter should be a boolean value. Any non-boolean value will be treated as False.
- The set\_executable function does not change the actual executable status of the file on the file system, it only sets the attribute of the file object. To change the actual executable status of the file, additional code is required.

In summary, the set\_executable function is used to set the executable attribute of a file object, and it is typically called in the context of reading and processing a list of files from an XML file. It is important to note that the function only sets the attribute of the file object and does not change the actual executable status of the file on the file system.
