## ClassDef roles
 **roles**: The function of the `roles` class is to initialize and run the `fill_roles()` function.

**attributes**: The `roles` class does not have any attributes.

**Code Description**:
The `roles` class has two methods: `__init__` and `run`. The `__init__` method is the constructor method that is automatically called when an object of this class is created. It does not take any parameters and has no implementation, as indicated by the `pass` statement.

The `run` method is where the main functionality of this class resides. It calls the `fill_roles()` function, which is presumably defined elsewhere in the codebase. The purpose of this function is not clear from the provided code, but it is likely that it is responsible for filling in the roles of some system or application.

From a functional perspective, the `roles` class is called by the `plugin_manager` object in the `plugin` module. This suggests that the `roles` class is a part of a plugin system, where it provides the functionality for managing roles in some capacity.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the `fill_roles()` function is not defined within the `roles` class, so it must be defined elsewhere in the codebase. Additionally, the `roles` class does not have any attributes, so any state that needs to be maintained between method calls must be stored elsewhere. Finally, the relationship between the `roles` class and the `plugin_manager` object suggests that this class is intended to be used as a plugin, so it should be designed and implemented with that in mind.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object of the roles class.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a special method in python classes, which is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class. In this case, the __init__ function does not initialize any attributes as it does not take any parameters. The pass statement is used when the syntax requires a statement, but you do not want any command or code to execute.

**Note**:

* The __init__ function is called automatically when an object is created from the class, and it should not be called directly.
* If there are any attributes that need to be initialized, they should be defined in this function with their respective initial values.
* The name of the function is always __init__ with two leading and two trailing underscores.
* This function can take any number of parameters, which will be used to initialize the attributes of the class.
* If the class has inherited from another class, then the __init__ function of the parent class should be called using the super() function before defining any attributes of the current class.

### FunctionDef run(self)
 **run**: The function of run is to execute the role initialization process by calling the `fill_roles` function.

**parameters**: The run function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

The `run` function is a simple function that calls the `fill_roles` function to initialize the necessary roles required for the system. It does not take any parameters and does not return any value.

When the `run` function is called, it executes the `fill_roles` function, which creates the necessary roles required for the system by calling the `create_role` function. It does this by first initializing the necessary paths and variables, then retrieving the roles and groups from their respective directories using the `get_roles` and `get_rolegroups` functions. It then calls the `create_role` function twice, once for each role, passing in the role name and the corresponding groups.

The `run` function is called in the `roles` module to initialize the roles required for the system. It is the entry point for the role initialization process and is responsible for ensuring that the necessary roles are created and available for use.

**Note**:

- The `run` function assumes that the necessary directories and files exist and are properly formatted. If any of these requirements are not met, the function may not behave as expected.
- The `run` function creates the roles in the system. If the roles already exist, they will be updated with the new groups.
- The `run` function does not produce any output on its own. The resulting roles can be verified using the `getent` command. For example, to verify the `localadmins` role, you can run the following command:
```
getent role localadmins
```
This command should display the `localadmins` role and its associated groups. Similarly, to verify the `users` role, you can run the following command:
```
getent role users
```
This command should display the `users` role and its associated groups.
