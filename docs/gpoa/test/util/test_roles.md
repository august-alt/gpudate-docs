## ClassDef RolesTestCase
 **RolesTestCase**: The function of RolesTestCase is to serve as a test case for the role module, specifically for testing utility functions related to roles.

**attributes**: This class does not have any attributes defined.

**Code Description**:

The RolesTestCase class inherits from unittest.TestCase, which is a basic test case class in Python's unittest module. This class provides methods for running tests, checking results, and handling test fixtures.

The RolesTestCase class contains one method, test\_roles(), which is decorated with the @unittest.skip decorator. This decorator causes the test to be skipped when the test runner is run. The reason for skipping the test is specified as 'Role module test disabled because of instability'.

The test\_roles() method is intended to test the utility functions for working with roles. However, since the test is skipped, it does not actually perform any testing. When the test is not skipped, the test\_roles() method calls the fill\_roles() function. The fill\_roles() function is not defined in the provided code, so it must be defined elsewhere in the project.

**Note**:

* The test\_roles() method is currently skipped due to instability in the role module. It is recommended to investigate the cause of the instability and fix it before running the test.
* The fill\_roles() function is not defined in the provided code. Make sure that this function is properly defined and imported before running the test.
* When writing test cases, it is important to ensure that they are independent, repeatable, and reliable. Test cases should be designed to test specific functionality and should not have unintended side effects.
### FunctionDef test_roles(self)
 **test\_roles**: The function of `test_roles` is to test the utility functions that work with roles.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

The `test_roles` function tests the roles utility functions by calling the `fill_roles` function. The `fill_roles` function creates the necessary roles required for the system by calling the `create_role` function. It does this by initializing the necessary paths and variables, then retrieving the roles and groups from their respective directories using the `get_roles` and `get_rolegroups` functions. It then calls the `create_role` function twice, once for each role, passing in the role name and the corresponding groups.

The `test_roles` function is a test case that is used to verify that the roles are created correctly. It does not produce any output on its own, but the resulting roles can be verified using the `getent` command.

The `test_roles` function calls the `fill_roles` function, which in turn calls the `get_roles`, `read_groups`, and `create_role` functions. It tests the functionality of these functions by checking if the roles are created correctly in the system.

**Note**:

- The `test_roles` function assumes that the necessary directories and files exist and are properly formatted. If any of these requirements are not met, the function may not behave as expected.
- The `test_roles` function does not produce any output on its own, but the resulting roles can be verified using the `getent` command.

Example usage:

To run the `test_roles` function, you can use the following command:
```
python -m unittest gpoa.test.util.test_roles.RolesTestCase.test_roles
```
This command runs the `test_roles` test case and displays the result.

To verify the roles created by the `fill_roles` function, you can use the `getent` command. For example, to verify the `localadmins` role, you can run the following command:
```
getent role localadmins
```
This command displays the `localadmins` role and its associated groups. Similarly, to verify the `users` role, you can run the following command:
```
getent role users
```
This command displays the `users` role and its associated groups.
