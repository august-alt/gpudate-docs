## ClassDef XDGTestCase
 **XDGTestCase**: The function of XDGTestCase is to test the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function by printing the desktop directories of the machine and a specific user.

**attributes**: This Class does not have any attributes.

**Code Description**:

The `XDGTestCase` Class extends the `unittest.TestCase` Class, which is a base class for tests that need to run in an unbuffered, interleaved manner. This Class is typically used for writing unit tests for modules.

The Class contains one method, `test_get_desktop_dir`, which tests the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function. The method prints the desktop directories of the machine and a specific user using the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function.

The `xdg_get_desktop_user` function takes a username as an argument and returns the desktop directory of that user. If no argument is provided, it returns the desktop directory of the machine.

The `print` function is used to display the output on the console.

**Note**:

* The `XDGTestCase` Class is typically used in a testing framework, and the output of the `print` function may not be visible when running the tests through the framework.
* The `xdg_get_desktop_user` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
* The `unittest` module must be imported before using the `XDGTestCase` Class.
* The `XDGTestCase` Class can be run as a test case in a test suite using the `unittest.main()` function.
* The `test_get_desktop_dir` method can be customized or overridden to test different scenarios or edge cases.
* The `None` argument passed to `xdg_get_desktop_user` function is used to get the desktop directory of the machine.
### FunctionDef test_get_desktop_dir(self)
 **test\_get\_desktop\_dir**：This function is used to test the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function with two different parameters.

**parameters**：This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**：

1. First, the function prints out the string 'Machine desktop:' to the console using the `print()` function.
2. Then, it calls the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function with `None` as the argument and prints out the returned value. This value represents the desktop directory of the current machine.
3. After that, the function prints out the string 'Users desktop:' to the console.
4. Finally, it calls the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function with the string 'nir' as the argument and prints out the returned value. This value represents the desktop directory of the user 'nir'.

**Note**：

- Make sure that the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function is properly implemented and returns the correct values for the given parameters.
- The function `test_get_desktop_dir` is a test function, which is used to test the functionality of the `xdg_get_desktop_user` function. It is not intended to be used in a production environment.
- The function `test_get_desktop_dir` is part of the `XDGTestCase` class, which contains various test cases for the `xdg` module.
- The `print()` function is used for debugging purposes and can be removed in a production environment.
- The function does not return any value. It only prints the values to the console.
