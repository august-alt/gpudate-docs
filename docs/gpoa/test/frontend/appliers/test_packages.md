## ClassDef PackageTestCase
 **PackageTestCase**: The function of PackageTestCase is to provide semi-integrational tests for packages installation and removal.

**attributes**: This class does not have any specific attributes. However, it inherits all the attributes of the unittest.TestCase class.

### FunctionDef test_package_not_exist(self)
 **test\_package\_not\_exist**: This function tests the scenario where a package does not exist during the RPM (RPM Package Manager) installation and removal process.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

1. `packages_for_install = 'dummy1 dummy2'`: This line declares a string variable named `packages_for_install` that contains a space-separated list of package names to be installed. In this case, the packages are 'dummy1' and 'dummy2'.

2. `packages_for_remove = 'dummy3'`: This line declares a string variable named `packages_for_remove` that contains a space-separated list of package names to be removed. In this case, the package is 'dummy3'.

3. `test_rpm = rpm(packages_for_install, packages_for_remove)`: This line creates an instance of the `rpm` class, passing the `packages_for_install` and `packages_for_remove` variables as arguments. This object will be used to apply the RPM operations.

4. `test_rpm.apply()`: This line calls the `apply` method of the `test_rpm` object, which performs the RPM installation and removal operations based on the packages provided during the object creation.

**Note**:

- The function does not check if the specified packages actually exist or not. It simply assumes that 'dummy1', 'dummy2', and 'dummy3' are valid package names for testing purposes.
- The primary goal of this function is to ensure that the RPM tool handles package non-existence gracefully, without causing any errors or unexpected behavior during the installation and removal process.
- Developers should ensure that proper error handling is implemented in the `rpm` class to manage package non-existence scenarios in a production environment.
- The function does not include any assertions or checks to validate the outcome of the RPM operations. Developers should incorporate appropriate validation logic to ensure the expected results are achieved.

### FunctionDef test_install_remove_same_package(self)
 **test\_install\_remove\_same\_package**: This function tests the installation and removal of the same package using the `rpm` object.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:

1. `packages_for_install` and `packages_for_remove` are both set to `'gotop'`. These variables hold the names of the packages to be installed and removed.
2. The `rpm` object is created with the `packages_for_install` and `packages_for_remove` variables as arguments. This object represents the RPM package manager and is used to install and remove packages.
3. The `apply` method is called on the `rpm` object. This method performs the installation and removal of the packages specified during the creation of the `rpm` object.

**Note**:

- This function tests the scenario where the same package is installed and then removed.
- The `rpm` object and its `apply` method are assumed to be defined and implemented elsewhere in the code.
- The function does not return any value. It only performs the installation and removal of packages using the `rpm` object.
- The function does not handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the installation or removal process. It is assumed that error handling is implemented elsewhere in the code.
- The function is a part of the `PackageTestCase` class and is intended to be used for testing purposes. It should not be used in production code.
- The function is a simple test case and does not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases. It is intended to be used as a basic example or starting point for more comprehensive tests.
- The function is dependent on the `rpm` package manager and the specific implementation of the `rpm` object and its `apply` method. It may not work with other package managers or implementations.
- The function is written in Python and assumes that the required packages and modules are installed and available in the environment. It may not work with other programming languages or environments.
