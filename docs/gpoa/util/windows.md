## ClassDef smbcreds
 **smbcreds**: The function of the `smbcreds` class is to manage and provide credentials for accessing a Samba domain. It handles the creation and manipulation of the necessary credentials options and objects required to authenticate with a Samba domain controller.

**Attributes**:
路 `dc_fqdn`: Fully qualified domain name of the domain controller.

**Code Description**:
The `smbcreds` class inherits from the `smbopts` class and extends its functionality to include domain-related operations. In the `__init__` method, it initializes the `smbopts` class and sets up the credentials options and credentials object. It also determines the domain controller, domain, and site servers based on the provided `dc_fqdn` or by querying the domain.

The `get_dc` method returns the currently selected domain controller, while the `set_dc` method sets the domain controller to the provided `dc_fqdn` or attempts to determine it automatically.

The `get_domain` method retrieves the current Active Directory domain name. It does this by querying the domain controller for the DNS domain name.

The `get_gpos` method retrieves the list of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for the specified `username` on the specified domain controller. It queries the domain controller using the Samba `ADS_STRUCT` class and returns the list of GPOs.

The `update_gpos` method updates the list of GPOs for the specified `username` on the specified domain controller. It does this by iteratively querying each domain controller in the domain until all GPOs have been retrieved.

The `smbcreds` class is used in the `gpoa/backend/__init__.py/backend_factory` to create a backend object based on the specified domain and credentials. It is also used within the `smbcreds` class itself to manage the domain-related operations.

**Note**:
The `smbcreds` class should only be used to interact with the Samba loadparm object and get properties from it. It is not recommended to modify the loadparm object using this class.

**Output Example**:
```python
creds = smbcreds('dc1.example.com')
print(creds.get_dc())
creds.set_dc('dc2.example.com')
print(creds.get_domain())
gpos = creds.get_gpos('user1')
print(gpos)
```
This will output the initially selected domain controller, the domain after setting it to a new domain controller, and the list of GPOs for the specified user on the domain.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, dc_fqdn)
 **\_\_init\_\_**: The function of **\_\_init\_\_** is to initialize an instance of the `smbcreds` class with the necessary credentials and settings to connect to a domain controller (DC) in a Samba network.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function are:
路 `dc_fqdn` (optional): A string representing the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the DC to be selected for the GPO Applier. If not provided, the function will automatically select a DC using the `get_dc_hostname` function.

**Code Description**:

The `__init__` function initializes an instance of the `smbcreds` class by performing the following steps:

1. It initializes the `credopts` attribute as an instance of the `CredentialsOptions` class from the `options` module, passing the current instance (`self`) as a parameter. This allows the `CredentialsOptions` instance to access the `parser` attribute of the current instance.
2. It calls the `get_credentials` method of the `credopts` instance to retrieve the necessary credentials for connecting to the DC. The `fallback_machine` parameter is set to `True`, which means that if no credentials are provided, the function will use the machine account credentials as a fallback.
3. It calls the `set_dc` function, passing the `dc_fqdn` parameter as an argument. This function sets the `selected_dc` attribute of the current instance to the FQDN of the selected DC.
4. It initializes the `sDomain` attribute as an instance of the `SiteDomainScanner` class, passing the `creds` and `lp` attributes of the current instance as parameters. This allows the `SiteDomainScanner` instance to access the necessary credentials and settings to scan the Active Directory (AD) domain.
5. It calls the `select_site_servers` method of the `sDomain` instance to retrieve a list of servers associated with the site determined by the local system's IP addresses.
6. It calls the `select_all_servers` method of the `sDomain` instance to retrieve a list of all servers in the AD.
7. It removes any servers that are also present in the `dc_site_servers` list from the `all_servers` list.
8. It calls the `select_pdc_emulator_server` method of the `sDomain` instance to retrieve the FQDN of the domain's Primary Domain Controller (PDC) emulator.

The `__init__` function plays a crucial role in initializing the `smbcreds` class with the necessary credentials and settings to connect to a DC in a Samba network. By automatically selecting a DC and initializing the `SiteDomainScanner` instance, the `__init__` function enables the `smbcreds` class to perform various operations related to the DC and the AD domain.

**Note**:

- The `__init__` function initializes the `credopts` attribute as an instance of the `CredentialsOptions` class, which provides a convenient way to retrieve the necessary credentials for connecting to the DC.
- The `__init__` function calls the `set_dc` function to set the `selected_dc` attribute of the current instance to the FQDN of the selected DC. This attribute is used by other methods of the `smbcreds` class to connect to the DC.
- The `__init__` function initializes the `sDomain` attribute as an instance of the `SiteDomainScanner` class, which provides various methods for scanning and retrieving information related to the AD domain.
- The `__init__` function calls the `select_site_servers`, `select_all_servers`, and `select_pdc_emulator_server` methods of the `sDomain` instance to retrieve various lists of servers and the PDC emulator for the domain. These lists are used by other methods of the `smbcreds` class to perform various operations related to the DC and the AD domain.
***
### FunctionDef get_dc(self)
 **get\_dc**: The function of get\_dc is to return the selected domain controller (DC).

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get\_dc function is a method of a class, as indicated by the "self" parameter. When called, it returns the value stored in the "selected\_dc" attribute of the class instance. The "selected\_dc" attribute should be set elsewhere in the class, as it is not set within this function.

**Note**: This function assumes that the "selected\_dc" attribute has already been set. If not, it will raise an error. Make sure to set the "selected\_dc" attribute before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Assuming a class instance with the following attribute
instance = MyClass()
instance.selected_dc = 'dc1.example.com'

# The output of the get_dc function will be:
print(instance.get_dc())  # Output: dc1.example.com
```
***
### FunctionDef set_dc(self, dc_fqdn)
 **set\_dc**: The function of set\_dc is to force the selection of the specified Domain Controller (DC) for the GPO Applier.

**parameters**:
路 dc\_fqdn: The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the DC to be selected. This parameter is optional and can be left as None, in which case the function will automatically select a DC using the get\_dc\_hostname function.

**Code Description**:

The function set\_dc first initializes the instance variable selected\_dc to None. This variable will hold the FQDN of the selected DC after the function has run.

If the parameter dc\_fqdn is not None, the function checks if it is a string and if it is not empty. If these conditions are met, the function logs the event of a user-selected DC using the log function from the logging.py module. The logdata dictionary contains the user-selected DC as its value.

If the parameter dc\_fqdn is None, the function calls the get\_dc\_hostname function to automatically select a DC. This function takes in two parameters, creds and lp, which are instance variables of the class. The selected DC is then stored in the instance variable selected\_dc.

If an exception occurs during the execution of the function, it is caught and logged using the log function from the logging.py module. The exception message is stored in the logdata dictionary as its value.

The function set\_dc is called in the **\_\_init\_\_** function of the smbcreds class in the same module. This is done to ensure that a DC is selected before any other functions of the class are called.

**Note**:

It is important to note that the function set\_dc initializes the instance variable selected\_dc to None. This variable is used in other functions of the smbcreds class, so it is important to ensure that it is properly initialized.

Additionally, the function logs events of user-selected DCs and exceptions using the log function from the logging.py module. This can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.

Finally, it is important to ensure that the parameter dc\_fqdn is a string and not empty before passing it to the function set\_dc. If it is not, the function will not select a DC and will instead raise an exception.
***
### FunctionDef get_domain(self)
 **get\_domain**: The function of get\_domain is to retrieve the current Active Directory domain name.

**parameters**:

路 self: The object instance that the method is called upon.

**Code Description**:

The function initializes the variable `dns_domainname` to None. It then attempts to get the CLDAP record about the domain using the `netcmd_get_domain_infos_via_cldap` function, passing in the `self.lp`, `None`, and `self.selected_dc` as arguments. If successful, the DNS domain name is extracted from the returned record and stored in the `dns_domainname` variable. A log message is then generated using the `log` function, passing in a dictionary containing the domain name.

If an exception occurs during the execution of the function, it is caught and logged using the `log` function with an error code. The original exception is then re-raised.

The function then returns the `dns_domainname` variable, which contains the current Active Directory domain name if the function was successful.

**Note**:

* The function uses the `netcmd_get_domain_infos_via_cldap` function, which is not defined in the provided code. It is assumed that this function is defined elsewhere and is available for use in this context.
* The `log` function is used to log messages and errors throughout the function. It is not defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to be a logging function that is available for use in this context.

**Output Example**:

The output of this function is a string containing the current Active Directory domain name. For example, the output might be "example.com".

**Relation with other parts of the project**:

This function is called by the `samba_backend` object, which is created by the `backend_factory` function in the `gpoa/backend/__init__.py` module. The `samba_backend` object uses the `get_domain` function to retrieve the current Active Directory domain name as part of its implementation. The `backend_factory` function creates an instance of the `smbcreds` object, which provides the `selected_dc` argument used by the `get_domain` function. The `log` function used by the `get_domain` function is defined in the `gpoa/util/logging.py` module.
***
### FunctionDef get_gpos(self, username)
 **get\_gpos**: The function of get\_gpos is to retrieve a list of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for a specified username and domain controller (DC).

**parameters**:
路 username (str): The username to retrieve the GPO list for.

**Code Description**:
The function `get_gpos` initializes an empty list `gpos` to store the retrieved GPOs. It then creates an `ADS_STRUCT` object `ads` using the `samba.gpo` module, which is used to interact with the GPOs on the DC. The `ADS_STRUCT` object is initialized with the selected DC, LDAP port (`lp`), and credentials (`creds`).

If the `ADS_STRUCT` object is able to connect to the DC, the function calls its `get_gpo_list` method with the `username` parameter to retrieve the list of GPOs for the user. For each GPO in the list, the function logs its name, UUID, and file system path using the `log` function.

If an exception occurs during the execution of the function, it is caught and logged using the `log` function. If the exception is a `GetGPOListFail` exception and the selected DC is not the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator, the function raises the exception to be handled by the caller. Otherwise, the function logs the exception details and re-raises the exception to be handled by the caller.

The `get_gpos` function is called by the `update_gpos` function in the `smbcreds` module of the `windows.py` file. The `update_gpos` function calls `get_gpos` with a specified `username` parameter and handles any `GetGPOListFail` exceptions that may be raised. If a `GetGPOListFail` exception is raised and the selected DC is not the PDC emulator, the `update_gpos` function changes the selected DC to the PDC emulator and re-calls `get_gpos` with the same `username` parameter.

**Note**:
- The `get_gpos` function requires valid credentials to connect to the DC and retrieve the GPO list.
- If a `GetGPOListFail` exception is raised and the selected DC is not the PDC emulator, the function will change the selected DC to the PDC emulator and re-call `get_gpos` with the same `username` parameter.

***
### FunctionDef update_gpos(self, username)
 **update\_gpos**: The function of update\_gpos is to update the Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for a specified username and domain controller (DC).

**parameters**:
路 username (str): The username to update the GPO list for.

**Code Description**:
The function `update_gpos` initializes an empty set `list_selected_dc` to store the domain controllers (DCs) that have been selected during the update process. It then checks if there are any site-specific DCs available. If there are, it selects one of them and removes it from the list of all available DCs. It then gets the list of GPOs for the specified `username` and the selected DC. If there is an exception while getting the GPO list, it selects the PDC emulator as the DC and tries again.

The function then enters a loop where it iterates over the list of selected DCs. For each DC, it logs the username and DC, and then tries to update the GPO list for that DC. If there is an exception while updating the GPO list, it checks if scrolling is enabled. If scrolling is not enabled, it selects the PDC emulator as the DC and tries again. If scrolling is enabled, it selects the next DC in the list of all available DCs. If there are no more available DCs, it raises the exception.

If there were no site-specific DCs available, the function selects the first DC from the list of all available DCs and gets the GPO list for that DC. It then enters the loop and tries to update the GPO list for each DC in the same way as described above.

The function is called by the `_get_gpts` function in the `samba_backend` module of the `samba_backend.py` file. The `_get_gpts` function calls `update_gpos` with a specified `username` parameter and handles any exceptions that may be raised. If an exception is raised and the selected DC is not the PDC emulator, the `_get_gpts` function changes the selected DC to the PDC emulator and re-calls `update_gpos` with the same `username` parameter.

**Note**:
- The `update_gpos` function requires valid credentials to connect to the DC and update the GPO list.
- If an exception is raised while getting or updating the GPO list, the function will try to select a different DC and continue the update process.

***
## ClassDef SiteDomainScanner
 **SiteDomainScanner** : The SiteDomainScanner class is used to scan and retrieve information related to the Active Directory (AD) domain, subnets, sites, and servers. It is mainly used to determine the site and servers associated with a given set of IP addresses.

**Attributes**:
- `smbcreds`: An instance of the SMBCredentials class, which contains the necessary credentials for accessing the AD.
- `lp`: A LdapPolicy object that contains the settings for establishing an LDAP connection.
- `dc`: The domain controller's FQDN to connect to.
- `samdb`: A SamDB object representing the connection to the AD.
- `pdc_emulator`: The FQDN of the domain's Primary Domain Controller (PDC) emulator.

**Code Description**:
The SiteDomainScanner class initializes a SamDB connection using the provided credentials, LdapPolicy, and domain controller. It then searches for the PDC emulator's FQDN within the AD.

The class provides several utility methods for interacting with the AD:
- `_get_ldb_single_message_attr` and `_get_ldb_single_result_attr`: Static methods for safely retrieving an attribute value from an LDB message or result.
- `_get_server_hostname`: Retrieves the hostname of a server given its service name in the AD.
- `_search_pdc_emulator`: Searches for the PDC emulator's FQDN in the AD.
- `get_ip_addresses`: Retrieves the IP addresses associated with the local system's network interfaces.
- `get_ad_subnets_sites`: Retrieves a dictionary containing the subnets and their associated sites from the AD.
- `get_ad_site_servers`: Retrieves a list of servers associated with a given site in the AD.
- `get_ad_all_servers`: Retrieves a list of all servers in the AD.
- `check_ip_in_subnets`: Checks if any of the given IP addresses are part of the provided subnets.
- `select_site_servers`: Retrieves a list of servers associated with the site determined by the local system's IP addresses.
- `select_all_servers`: Retrieves a list of all servers in the AD.
- `select_pdc_emulator_server`: Retrieves the FQDN of the domain's PDC emulator.

The SiteDomainScanner class is used by the gpoa/util/windows.py/smbcreds/__init__ object to determine the site and servers associated with the local system, and to retrieve a list of all servers in the AD.

**Note**:
- The SiteDomainScanner class relies on the `netifaces` and `ipaddress` modules for retrieving IP addresses, and the `ldb` module for interacting with the AD.
- Make sure the necessary modules and credentials are available when using the SiteDomainScanner class.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Example usage of SiteDomainScanner

import gpoa.util.windows.smbcreds as smbcreds

# Initialize the SMBCredentials object
smb_creds = smbcreds.SMBCredentials(dc_fqdn="dc.example.com")

# Initialize the SiteDomainScanner object
site_scanner = smbcreds.SiteDomainScanner(smb_creds, lp, dc_fqdn)

# Retrieve the site's servers
site_servers = site_scanner.select_site_servers()

# Retrieve all servers in the AD
all_servers = site_scanner.select_all_servers()

# Print the results
print("Site servers:", site_servers)
print("All servers:", all_servers)
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, smbcreds, lp, dc)
 **`__init__`**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize an instance of the `SiteDomainScanner` class.

**parameters**: This constructor takes three parameters.
路 `smbcreds`: A tuple of SMB credentials used to authenticate the LDAP connection.
路 `lp`: An LDAP profile used to configure the LDAP connection.
路 `dc`: The domain controller to connect to.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` method performs the following operations:

1. It initializes the `samdb` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` class by creating a new `SamDB` object with the provided `smbcreds`, `lp`, and `dc` as parameters. The `SamDB` object is used to interact with the Active Directory database.
2. It initializes the `pdc_emulator` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` class by calling the `_search_pdc_emulator` method, which searches for the PDC (Primary Domain Controller) emulator in the current domain.

The `__init__` method is responsible for setting up the necessary attributes for the `SiteDomainScanner` class to function properly. It initializes the `samdb` attribute with a valid LDB connection object and the `pdc_emulator` attribute with the DN of the PDC emulator if it exists in the LDB search result.

**Relationship with its callees**:

- The `__init__` method calls the `_search_pdc_emulator` method to initialize the `pdc_emulator` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` class.

**Note**:

- The `__init__` method assumes that the provided `smbcreds`, `lp`, and `dc` parameters are valid and can be used to establish a connection to the Active Directory database.
- If the `_search_pdc_emulator` method returns `None`, the `pdc_emulator` attribute will also be initialized to `None`.
- The `__init__` method does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it initializes the attributes of the `SiteDomainScanner` class, which can be used later in the code.
***
### FunctionDef _get_ldb_single_message_attr(ldb_message, attr_name, encoding)
 **`_get_ldb_single_message_attr`**: The function of `_get_ldb_single_message_attr` is to retrieve the specified attribute value from an LDB message object.

**parameters**
路 `ldb_message`: An LDB message object representing an entry in the Active Directory database.
路 `attr_name`: A string representing the name of the attribute to retrieve from the LDB message object.
路 `encoding`: (Optional) The encoding to use when converting the attribute value to a string. Defaults to 'utf8'.

**Code Description**
The function `_get_ldb_single_message_attr` takes an LDB message object and an attribute name as input, and returns the value of the specified attribute as a string. If the attribute is not present in the LDB message object, the function returns `None`.

The function first checks if the specified attribute name exists in the LDB message object using the `in` keyword. If the attribute name exists, the function retrieves the value of the attribute using the `ldb_message[attr_name][0]` syntax, which returns the first value of the attribute as a byte string. The function then decodes the byte string to a Unicode string using the specified encoding, which defaults to 'utf8'.

This function is used in various parts of the `SiteDomainScanner` class to retrieve specific attribute values from LDB message objects. For example, in the `get_ad_subnets_sites` method, the function is used to retrieve the 'cn' and 'siteObject' attributes of each subnet entry in the Active Directory database.

**Note**
- The function returns `None` if the specified attribute is not present in the LDB message object.
- The `encoding` parameter is optional and defaults to 'utf8'.

**Output Example**
Suppose we have an LDB message object `ldb_msg` with the following attributes:
```python
{'cn': [b'Subnet1'], 'siteObject': [b'Site1'], 'description': [b'Description of Subnet1']}
```
Calling `_get_ldb_single_message_attr(ldb_msg, 'cn')` would return the string `'Subnet1'`, while calling `_get_ldb_single_message_attr(ldb_msg, 'description')` would return the string `'Description of Subnet1'`. Calling `_get_ldb_single_message_attr(ldb_msg, 'non_existent_attr')` would return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef _get_ldb_single_result_attr(ldb_result, attr_name, encoding)
 **`_get_ldb_single_result_attr`**: The function of `_get_ldb_single_result_attr` is to retrieve the attribute value from a single result of an LDB (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) search result.

**parameters**:
- `ldb_result`: The LDB search result as a list of records.
- `attr_name`: The name of the attribute to retrieve from the result.
- `encoding`: The encoding to use when decoding the attribute value (default is 'utf8').

**Code Description**:
The function first checks if the `ldb_result` has only one record and if the specified `attr_name` exists in that record. If both conditions are met, it returns the first value of the attribute as a decoded string using the provided `encoding`. If not, it returns `None`.

This function is used within the `SiteDomainScanner` class in the `_get_server_hostname` and `_search_pdc_emulator` methods to retrieve specific attributes from LDB search results.

**Relationship with its callers**:
- In the `_get_server_hostname` method, it is used to retrieve the 'dNSHostName' attribute value from the LDB search result.
- In the `_search_pdc_emulator` method, it is used to retrieve the 'fSMORoleOwner' attribute value from the LDB search result.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `ldb_result` is a valid LDB search result and `attr_name` is a valid attribute name.
- The function will return `None` if the `ldb_result` is empty, has more than one record, or the specified `attr_name` does not exist in the record.

**Output Example**:
- If the `ldb_result` is `[{'dNSHostName': [b'DC01.example.com']}]` and `attr_name` is 'dNSHostName', the function will return 'DC01.example.com'.
- If the `ldb_result` is `[{'dNSHostName': []}]` and `attr_name` is 'dNSHostName', the function will return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef _get_server_hostname(self, ds_service_name)
 **`_get_server_hostname`**: The function of `_get_server_hostname` is to retrieve the hostname of the server from the LDB (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) search result by finding the parent DN (Distinguished Name) of a given service name and searching for the 'dNSHostName' attribute value in the LDB search result.

**parameters**:
- `ds_service_name`: The service name for which the server hostname needs to be retrieved.

**Code Description**:
The function `_get_server_hostname` takes a service name as an input and performs the following operations:

1. It creates a DN (Distinguished Name) for the service name using the `samdb` object of the `SiteDomainScanner` class.
2. It obtains the parent DN of the service name DN.
3. It searches the LDB using the parent DN and scope as base.
4. It calls the `_get_ldb_single_result_attr` function with the search result and 'dNSHostName' as parameters to retrieve the 'dNSHostName' attribute value from the LDB search result.
5. It returns the 'dNSHostName' attribute value as a decoded string.

The function `_get_server_hostname` is used within the `SiteDomainScanner` class in the `_search_pdc_emulator` method to retrieve the 'dNSHostName' attribute value from the LDB search result.

**Relationship with its callees**:
- The `_get_server_hostname` function calls the `_get_ldb_single_result_attr` function to retrieve the 'dNSHostName' attribute value from the LDB search result.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `ds_service_name` is a valid service name and `samdb` is a valid LDB connection object.
- The function will return `None` if the LDB search result is empty, has more than one record, or the 'dNSHostName' attribute does not exist in the record.

**Output Example**:
- If the `ds_service_name` is 'DC01$', the function will return 'DC01.example.com' if the LDB search result is `[{'dNSHostName': [b'DC01.example.com']}]`.
- If the `ds_service_name` is 'DC01$', the function will return `None` if the LDB search result is `[{'dNSHostName': []}]`.
***
### FunctionDef _search_pdc_emulator(self)
 **`_search_pdc_emulator`**: The function of `_search_pdc_emulator` is to search for the PDC (Primary Domain Controller) emulator in the current domain.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function `_search_pdc_emulator` performs the following operations:

1. It searches the LDB (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) using the base DN (Distinguished Name) of the current domain and scope as base.
2. It calls the `_get_ldb_single_result_attr` function with the search result and 'fSMORoleOwner' as parameters to retrieve the 'fSMORoleOwner' attribute value from the LDB search result.
3. It returns the 'fSMORoleOwner' attribute value as a decoded string.

The `_search_pdc_emulator` function is used within the `SiteDomainScanner` class in the `__init__` method to initialize the `pdc_emulator` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` class.

**Relationship with its callees**:

- The `_search_pdc_emulator` function calls the `_get_ldb_single_result_attr` function to retrieve the 'fSMORoleOwner' attribute value from the LDB search result.

**Note**:

- The function assumes that the `samdb` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` class is a valid LDB connection object.
- The function will return `None` if the LDB search result is empty, has more than one record, or the 'fSMORoleOwner' attribute does not exist in the record.

**Output Example**:

- If the current domain is 'example.com', the function will return the DN of the PDC emulator if it exists in the LDB search result. For example, 'CN=DC01,CN=Servers,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=example,DC=com'.
- If the current domain does not have a PDC emulator, the function will return `None`.
***
### FunctionDef get_ip_addresses(self)
 **get\_ip\_addresses**: The function of get\_ip\_addresses is to retrieve and return the list of IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) configured on the system.

**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function begins by initializing an empty list `addresses` to store the IP addresses. It then proceeds to gather information about the network interfaces available on the system using the `netifaces.interfaces()` function, which returns a list of interface names.

For each interface in the list, the function retrieves additional information about the interface using the `netifaces.ifaddresses(iface)` function, which returns a dictionary containing details about the interface. The function checks if either IPv4 (`AF_INET`) or IPv6 (`AF_INET6`) addresses are associated with the interface by inspecting the keys present in the dictionary.

If IPv4 addresses are present, it iterates over the `addr` entries in the `AF_INET` section of the dictionary, converts each entry to an `ipaddress.IPv4Address` object using `ipaddress.ip_address(ipv4_address_entry['addr'])`, and appends it to the `addresses` list. A similar process is followed for IPv6 addresses.

Finally, the function returns the `addresses` list containing all the IP addresses found on the system.

(Detailed and CERTAIN code analysis and description...And please include the relationship with its callers in the project from a functional perspective.)

The `get_ip_addresses` function is utilized by the `select_site_servers` function in the `SiteDomainScanner` class to obtain the IP addresses of the system. These IP addresses are then used to determine the Active Directory subnets and sites associated with the system, and subsequently, the site servers are selected based on the system's site.

**Note**:
1. The function relies on the `netifaces` library to gather information about the network interfaces and their addresses. Ensure that the library is installed and available in the project environment.
2. The function supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Depending on the system configuration, the list of IP addresses returned may contain either IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, or both.

**Output Example**:
For a system with the following network interfaces and addresses:

* eth0: 192.168.1.2/24, fe80::a00:27ff:fe98:a76/64
* lo: 127.0.0.1/8, ::1/128

The `get_ip_addresses` function would return:

[192.168.1.2, 172.17.0.1, fe80::a00:27ff:fe98:a76, ::1]
***
### FunctionDef get_ad_subnets_sites(self)
 **get_ad_subnets_sites**: The function of `get_ad_subnets_sites` is to retrieve a dictionary of Active Directory (AD) subnets and their corresponding sites from the AD database.

**parameters**
路 None: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The function `get_ad_subnets_sites` is a method of the `SiteDomainScanner` class and is used to retrieve a dictionary of AD subnets and their corresponding sites from the AD database.

First, the function creates a distinguished name (DN) for the Subnets container in the Sites container of the AD database using the `ldb.Dn` class. It then gets the configuration basedn for the AD database using the `self.samdb.get_config_basedn()` method. The Subnets container DN is then added to the configuration basedn to create a search base for the AD query.

Next, the function searches the AD database for all subnet entries in the Subnets container using the `self.samdb.search()` method. The search scope is set to `ldb.SCOPE_ONELEVEL`, which means that only entries immediately below the search base will be returned. The search filter is set to `expression='objectClass=subnet'`, which means that only entries with an objectClass attribute of "subnet" will be returned. The search attributes are set to `['cn', 'siteObject']`, which means that only the 'cn' and 'siteObject' attributes of the returned entries will be retrieved.

The function then creates a dictionary of subnets and their corresponding sites using a dictionary comprehension. The keys of the dictionary are the IP networks of the subnets, which are created using the `ipaddress.ip_network()` function and the 'cn' attribute values of the subnet entries. The values of the dictionary are the 'siteObject' attribute values of the subnet entries, which represent the corresponding sites of the subnets.

This function is used in the `select_site_servers` method of the `SiteDomainScanner` class to determine the site of the local machine and retrieve the list of servers in that site.

**Note**
- This function does not take any parameters.
- The function returns a dictionary of AD subnets and their corresponding sites.

**Output Example**
Suppose the AD database contains the following subnet entries:
```python
{'cn': [b'10.0.0.0/8'], 'siteObject': [b'Site1']}
{'cn': [b'192.168.0.0/16'], 'siteObject': [b'Site2']}
{'cn': [b'172.16.0.0/12'], 'siteObject': [b'Site3']}
```
Calling `get_ad_subnets_sites` method would return the following dictionary:
```python
{IPNetwork('10.0.0.0/8'): b'Site1', IPNetwork('192.168.0.0/16'): b'Site2', IPNetwork('172.16.0.0/12'): b'Site3'}
```
This dictionary can be used to map IP addresses to their corresponding sites in the AD database.

### FunctionDef get_ad_site_servers(self, site)
 **get\_ad\_site\_servers**: The function of `get_ad_site_servers` is to retrieve a list of server hostnames for a given Active Directory site.

**parameters**
路 `site`: A string representing the distinguished name (DN) of the Active Directory site for which to retrieve server hostnames.

***
### FunctionDef get_ad_all_servers(self)
 **get\_ad\_all\_servers**: The function of `get_ad_all_servers` is to retrieve a list of all servers in the Active Directory domain.

**parameters**:
路 `self`: The instance of the `SiteDomainScanner` class that the method is called on.

***
### FunctionDef check_ip_in_subnets(self, ip_addresses, subnets_sites)
 **check\_ip\_in\_subnets**: The function of check\_ip\_in\_subnets is to search for the site that the IP addresses belong to in the given subnets-sites dictionary.

**parameters**:
路 ip\_addresses: A list of IP addresses to be checked.
路 subnets\_sites: A dictionary where the keys are subnets and the values are site names.

**Code Description**:
The function uses the `next()` function with a generator expression to iterate over the keys (subnets) in the `subnets_sites` dictionary. For each subnet, it checks if any of the IP addresses in `ip_addresses` is within the subnet using the `any()` function and the subnet-IP comparison. If a match is found, the corresponding site name is returned. If no match is found after checking all subnets, `None` is returned.

From a functional perspective, this function plays a crucial role in determining the site that the IP addresses belong to in the `select_site_servers` function. By calling `check_ip_in_subnets`, the `select_site_servers` function can identify the site and proceed with further operations accordingly.

**Note**:
- The `check_ip_in_subnets` function assumes that the subnets in the `subnets_sites` dictionary are in CIDR notation.
- If the `ip_addresses` list is empty, the function will return `None` without iterating over the subnets.

**Output Example**:
For the given parameters:
```python
ip_addresses = ['192.168.1.1', '10.0.0.1']
subnets_sites = {
    '192.168.0.0/16': 'SiteA',
    '10.0.0.0/8': 'SiteB'
}
```
The function will return:
```python
'SiteB'
```

### FunctionDef select_site_servers(self)
 **select\_site\_servers**: The function of `select_site_servers` is to determine and return a list of server hostnames for the site that the local machine belongs to in the Active Directory (AD) environment.

**parameters**
路 None: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The `select_site_servers` function is a method of the `SiteDomainScanner` class and is used to retrieve a list of server hostnames for the site that the local machine belongs to in the AD environment.

First, the function calls the `get_ip_addresses` method to retrieve the list of IP addresses configured on the system. It then calls the `get_ad_subnets_sites` method to retrieve a dictionary of AD subnets and their corresponding sites from the AD database.

Next, the function calls the `check_ip_in_subnets` method to determine the site of the local machine based on its IP addresses and the subnets-sites dictionary. If the local machine's site is found, the function calls the `get_ad_site_servers` method to retrieve a list of server hostnames for the site.

The function then randomizes the order of the server hostnames in the list using the `random.shuffle` function and returns the list. If any exception occurs during the execution of the function, an empty list is returned.

From a functional perspective, this function plays a crucial role in determining the site that the local machine belongs to and retrieving the list of servers in that site. This information is essential for various operations in the Active Directory environment, such as Group Policy Object (GPO) processing and management.

**Note**
- This function does not take any parameters.
- The function returns a list of server hostnames for the site that the local machine belongs to in the AD environment.
- The function relies on the `get_ip_addresses`, `get_ad_subnets_sites`, `check_ip_in_subnets`, and `get_ad_site_servers` methods to retrieve the necessary information from the system and the AD database.
- The function supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Depending on the system configuration, the list of IP addresses returned by the `get_ip_addresses` method may contain either IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses, or both.

**Output Example**
Suppose the AD database contains the following subnet entries:
```python
{'cn': [b'10.0.0.0/8'], 'siteObject': [b'Site1']}
{'cn': [b'192.168.0.0/16'], 'siteObject': [b'Site2']}
{'cn': [b'172.16.0.0/12'], 'siteObject': [b'Site3']}
```
And the system has the following IP addresses:
```python
['192.168.1.2', 'fe80::a00:27ff:fe98:a76']
```
Calling `select_site_servers` method would return a list of server hostnames for Site2, randomized in order:
```python
['server1.site2.domain.com', 'server2.site2.domain.com', 'server3.site2.domain.com']
```
This list of server hostnames can be used for various operations in the Active Directory environment, such as GPO processing and management.

### FunctionDef select_all_servers(self)
 **select\_all\_servers**: The function of `select_all_servers` is to retrieve a list of all servers in the Active Directory domain and return them in a shuffled order.

**parameters**:
路 `self`: The instance of the `SiteDomainScanner` class that the method is called on.

***
### FunctionDef select_pdc_emulator_server(self)
 **select\_pdc\_emulator\_server**: The function of `select_pdc_emulator_server` is to return the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) emulator server for a given domain.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `select_pdc_emulator_server` function is a method of the `SiteDomainScanner` class, which is defined in the `windows.py` module of the `util` package in the `gpoa` project. This function returns the `pdc_emulator` attribute of the `SiteDomainScanner` object, which is an instance of the `DomainDs` class from the `samba.domaldap` module. The `DomainDs` class represents a domain in a Samba network, and its `pdc_emulator` attribute contains the server object for the PDC emulator for the domain.

The `select_pdc_emulator_server` function is called in the `__init__` method of the `Smbcreds` class, which is defined in the `__init__.py` module of the `smbcreds` package in the `util` package of the `gpoa` project. In the `__init__` method, the `select_pdc_emulator_server` function is called on a `SiteDomainScanner` object, which is stored in the `sDomain` attribute of the `Smbcreds` object. The result of calling `select_pdc_emulator_server` is stored in the `pdc_emulator_server` attribute of the `Smbcreds` object.

**Note**: It is important to note that the `select_pdc_emulator_server` function returns the PDC emulator for the domain, which is a special server that maintains the master copy of the domain's security database and is responsible for handling password changes and authentication requests for the domain.

**Output Example**: A possible appearance of the code's return value is:

`<DomainDs server_name='PDC-EMULATOR-NAME' domain_name='DOMAIN-NAME' forest_name='FOREST-NAME' site_name='SITE-NAME' type='pdc' realm='REALM-NAME' netbios_domain_name='NETBIOS-DOMAIN-NAME' domain_guid=DomainGuid domain_sid=DomainSid>`

Where `PDC-EMULATOR-NAME` is the name of the PDC emulator server, `DOMAIN-NAME` is the name of the domain, `FOREST-NAME` is the name of the forest, `SITE-NAME` is the name of the site, `REALM-NAME` is the name of the realm, `NETBIOS-DOMAIN-NAME` is the NetBIOS name of the domain, `DomainGuid` is the globally unique identifier (GUID) of the domain, and `DomainSid` is the security identifier (SID) of the domain.

## FunctionDef expand_windows_var(text, username)
 **expand\_windows\_var**: The function of expand\_windows\_var is to scan a given text string for percent-encoded Windows environment variables and expand them using a predefined set of variables and the xdg\_get\_desktop function from the xdg module.

**parameters**:
路 text (str): The input text string to scan for percent-encoded variables.
路 username (str, optional): The username for which to retrieve the desktop directory. If not provided, the function will use the current user's username. Defaults to None.

**Code Description**:
The function `expand_windows_var` first defines a dictionary of predefined environment variables with their corresponding values. It then checks if the `username` parameter is provided. If it is, the function uses the `get_homedir` function to get the home directory for that user and updates the `HOME`, `HOMEPATH`, and `StartMenuDir` variables accordingly.

The function then iterates over the keys in the `variables` dictionary and replaces any occurrence of the format `%variable%` in the `text` string with the corresponding value from the `variables` dictionary. It is important to note that the function only performs the replacement if the variable value ends with a forward slash (`/`). This is to ensure that the expanded variable is treated as a directory and not as a file.

Finally, the function returns the modified `text` string with the expanded variables.

**Relation with other parts of the project**:
This function is used in the `act` method of the `Envvar` class in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/envvar.py` to expand the value of environment variables before writing them to a file. It is also used in the `__init__` method of the `Files_cp` class in `gpoa/frontend/appliers/file_cp.py` to expand the `targetPath` and `fromPath` parameters of the `file_obj` object.

**Relation with external libraries**:
This function uses the `get_homedir` function from the `gpoa/util/util.py` module to get the home directory for a given user. It also uses the `xdg_get_desktop` function from the `gpoa/util/xdg.py` module to get the path of the desktop directory for a given user.

**Note**:
It is important to note that this function relies on the `xdg_get_desktop` function being available and properly configured. If the function is not available or not properly configured, this function may return an incorrect or incomplete path.

**Output Example**:
```
'C:\Users\user\Desktop\file.txt'
```
This is an example of the output that this function may return, given a `text` of `'%DesktopDir%\file.txt'` and a `username` of `'user'`. The actual output will vary depending on the specific user and the configuration of the system.
## FunctionDef transform_windows_path(text)
 **transform\_windows\_path**: This function attempts to convert Windows-style paths to a UNIX-like format.

**parameters**
路 `text`: A string representing a file path in Windows format.

**Code Description**
The function `transform_windows_path` takes a string `text` as input, which represents a file path in Windows format. It first initializes a variable `result` to the input `text`. If the input string ends with '.exe' (case-insensitive), the function replaces all backslashes ('\\') with forward slashes ('/'), removes the '.exe' extension, and then extracts the last portion of the path after the last slash. This results in a UNIX-like path format.

This function is primarily used to normalize Windows paths when reading GPT shortcuts, making it easier to work with paths in a more standardized format.

**Note**
- The function does not modify the original input `text`. Instead, it creates a new string `result` to store the transformed path.
- The function does not check if the input string is a valid Windows path. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure the input string is a valid path.

**Output Example**
For a Windows path like `C:\Users\Username\Documents\example.exe`, the function will return `Documents/example`.

For a Windows path like `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`, the function will return `System32/calc`.

For a Windows path like `C:\Users\Username\test.txt`, the function will return the same input `C:\Users\Username\test.txt`, as it does not end with '.exe'.
## FunctionDef check_scroll_enabled
 **check\_scroll\_enabled**: The function of check\_scroll\_enabled is to determine whether scrolling is enabled in the system. It does this by accessing the registry and checking the value of a specific key.

**parameters**:
路 None: The function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The function check\_scroll\_enabled first creates a registry object by calling the registry\_factory function with the argument 'registry'. This object is used to interact with the system registry.

Next, it defines a string variable 'enable\_scroll' which holds the path of the registry key that needs to be checked. The key 'ScrollSysvolDC' is located under 'Software\\BaseALT\\Policies\\GPUpdate'.

The function then calls the get\_hklm\_entry method of the registry object, passing the 'enable\_scroll' variable as an argument. This method retrieves the value of the specified registry key.

If the registry key exists and has a value, the function converts the value to an integer and then to a boolean. It then returns this boolean value, which indicates whether scrolling is enabled or not.

If the registry key does not exist, the function returns False, indicating that scrolling is disabled.

**Note**:
The function check\_scroll\_enabled is used in the update\_gpos function of the smbcreds module to determine whether to scroll the console window when updating GPOs. If scrolling is not enabled, the function will not scroll the console window, even if there are more items to display.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how to use the check\_scroll\_enabled function:

```python
result = check_scroll_enabled()
if result:
    print("Scrolling is enabled.")
else:
    print("Scrolling is disabled.")
```

In this example, the function check\_scroll\_enabled is called and its return value is stored in the variable 'result'. If the value is True, the message "Scrolling is enabled." is printed to the console. If the value is False, the message "Scrolling is disabled." is printed instead.
