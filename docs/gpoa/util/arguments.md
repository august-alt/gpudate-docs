## FunctionDef set_loglevel(loglevel_num)
 **set\_loglevel**: The function of set\_loglevel is to set the log level global value based on the input parameter.

**parameters**:
· loglevel\_num: This is an optional parameter with a default value of None. It represents the log level number that the user wants to set.

## FunctionDef process_target(target_name)
 **process\_target**: The function of process\_target is to determine and return the specified target, which can be 'All', 'Computer' or 'User'.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.

· target\_name: optional, a string representing the name of the target. If not provided, 'All' will be used as the default value.

## ClassDef ExitCodeUpdater
 **ExitCodeUpdater**: The ExitCodeUpdater class defines the different exit codes that can be returned by the gpupdate application, providing a contract for the application's exit status.

**Attributes**:
- EXIT\_SUCCESS: An exit code indicating that the gpupdate application has completed successfully.
- FAIL\_NO\_RUNNER: An exit code indicating that the gpupdate application failed to start because no runner was found.
- FAIL\_GPUPDATE\_COMPUTER\_NOREPLY: An exit code indicating that the gpupdate application failed to update computer policy due to no reply.
- FAIL\_GPUPDATE\_USER\_NOREPLY: An exit code indicating that the gpupdate application failed to update user policy due to no reply.
- EXIT\_SIGINT: An exit code indicating that the gpupdate application received an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

**Code Description**:
The ExitCodeUpdater class is a subclass of the `IntEnum` class, which is a specialized enumeration class for integer values. This class defines a set of named constants for the different exit codes that can be returned by the gpupdate application.

The `EXIT_SUCCESS` constant is used to indicate that the gpupdate application has completed successfully. The `FAIL_NO_RUNNER` constant is used when the gpupdate application fails to start because no runner was found. The `FAIL_GPUPDATE_COMPUTER_NOREPLY` and `FAIL_GPUPDATE_USER_NOREPLY` constants are used when the gpupdate application fails to update computer or user policy due to no reply. The `EXIT_SIGINT` constant is used when the gpupdate application receives an interrupt signal (SIGINT), indicating that the user has requested to terminate the application.

The `EXIT_SIGINT` constant is used in the `signal_handler` function in the `gpoa/util/signals.py` module. When the gpupdate application receives an interrupt signal, the `signal_handler` function is called, which prints a message to the console, ignores further signals, cleans up the Kerberos cache, and then exits the application with the `EXIT_SIGINT` exit code.

**Note**:
- The ExitCodeUpdater class should be used to define the exit codes for the gpupdate application, providing a clear contract for the application's exit status.
- The `EXIT_SIGINT` constant should be used in the `signal_handler` function to indicate that the gpupdate application has received an interrupt signal and is exiting gracefully.
- The exit codes defined in the ExitCodeUpdater class should be used consistently throughout the gpupdate application to indicate the different exit scenarios.
