## ClassDef cache
 **cache**: The `cache` class is an abstract base class (ABC) that provides a basic interface for storing and retrieving data using string identifiers. It is designed to be a parent class for concrete cache implementations.

**attributes**:

- `store(str_id: str, value: Any) -> None`: Stores a value in the cache using a string identifier.
- `get(obj_id: str) -> Any or None`: Retrieves a value from the cache using a string identifier. Returns `None` if the value is not found.
- `get_default(obj_id: str, default_value: Any) -> Any`: Retrieves a value from the cache using a string identifier. If the value is not found, it stores the `default_value` in the cache and returns it.

**Code Description**:

The `cache` class is an abstract base class that defines a basic interface for storing and retrieving data using string identifiers. It has three class methods: `store`, `get`, and `get_default`.

The `store` method takes a string identifier and a value as arguments and stores the value in the cache using the identifier. This method is intended to be overridden by concrete cache implementations.

The `get` method takes a string identifier as an argument and retrieves the corresponding value from the cache. If the value is not found, it returns `None`.

The `get_default` method takes a string identifier and a default value as arguments. It retrieves the value from the cache using the identifier. If the value is not found, it stores the default value in the cache and returns it.

The `cache` class is designed to be a parent class for concrete cache implementations. It does not contain any implementation details for storing and retrieving data. Instead, it provides a basic interface that concrete cache implementations can use to provide consistent behavior.

**Note**:

- The `cache` class is an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated directly. Concrete cache implementations should inherit from this class and provide their own implementation of the `store` method.
- The `cache` class is intended to be used as a parent class for concrete cache implementations. It does not contain any implementation details for storing and retrieving data. Instead, it provides a basic interface that concrete cache implementations can use to provide consistent behavior.
- The `get` method returns `None` if the value is not found in the cache. Concrete cache implementations may choose to provide a different default value or raise an exception in this case.

The `cache` class is used as a parent class for the `sqlite_cache` class in the `gpoa/storage/sqlite_cache.py` module. The `sqlite_cache` class provides a concrete implementation of the `cache` interface using an SQLite database. It overrides the `store` method to store data in the database and the `get` method to retrieve data from the database. The `sqlite_cache` class also provides a `get_default` method that returns a default value if the requested data is not found in the cache.

The `sqlite_cache` class uses the `cache` class as a parent class to provide a consistent interface for storing and retrieving data. By using the `cache` class as a parent class, the `sqlite_cache` class can be used interchangeably with other concrete cache implementations that inherit from the `cache` class. This allows developers to write code that works with any concrete cache implementation, making it easier to switch between different cache implementations as needed.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the cache object.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a special method in python, which is automatically called when an object of a class is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the class. In this case, it is used to initialize the cache object. As there are no parameters defined in the function, it does not take any arguments.

The function contains only the pass statement, which is a placeholder and does nothing when executed. It is used when the syntax requires a statement, but you do not want any command or code to execute. In this case, it is likely that the actual initialization code has been implemented elsewhere, and this __init__ function is left as a placeholder or is intended to be overridden in a subclass.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function is called automatically when an object is created. Therefore, you don't need to call it explicitly.
- If you want to initialize any attributes of the class, you can define them as instance variables in this function.
- If you want to add any custom behavior when the object is created, you can define it in this function.
- If you are subclassing this class and want to add or modify the initialization behavior, you can override this function in the subclass.

### FunctionDef store(self, str_id, value)
 **store**: The function of store is to save a given value to a specific location in the cache using its unique string ID.

**parameters**:
· str\_id: A unique string identifier for the value being stored.
· value: The value to be stored in the cache.

**Code Description**:
The store function is a method of the cache object, which takes in two parameters: str\_id and value. The str\_id parameter is used as a unique key to identify the value in the cache, while the value parameter is the data that needs to be stored in the cache.

The store function does not contain any implementation details, as it is marked with the `pass` statement. In a real-world scenario, this function would contain the necessary logic to store the value in the cache using the provided string ID.

**Note**:
- The str\_id parameter must be unique for each value stored in the cache.
- The value parameter can be of any data type that can be serialized and stored in the cache.
- The actual implementation of storing the value in the cache is not provided in this code snippet and should be added according to the specific cache implementation used.
- The store function may raise exceptions if there are any issues with the cache implementation or if the provided str\_id is not unique. It is recommended to handle these exceptions appropriately in a production environment.

### FunctionDef get(self, obj_id)
 **get**: The function of get is to retrieve an object from the cache using its ID.

**parameters**:
· obj\_id: The unique identifier of the object stored in the cache.

**Code Description**:
The get function is a method of the cache class, which is used to retrieve an object from the cache using its ID. The function takes one parameter, obj\_id, which is the unique identifier of the object stored in the cache.

When this function is called, it looks up the object with the given obj\_id in the cache. If the object is found, the function returns it. If the object is not found, the function returns None.

The implementation of this function is very straightforward. It starts by defining a function called get with a single parameter, obj\_id. The function then checks if the cache (which is an attribute of the cache object) contains an item with the key obj\_id. If it does, the function returns the value associated with that key. If it does not, the function returns None.

**Note**:
- The obj\_id parameter should be a hashable object, as it is used as a key in a dictionary.
- If the cache is large, searching for an object by ID may be slow. In this case, consider using a different data structure, such as a hash table.
- The get function does not handle errors that may occur when accessing the cache. If an error occurs, it will be raised to the caller.
***
### FunctionDef get_default(self, obj_id, default_value)
 **get\_default**: The function of get\_default is to retrieve the default value of a given object's attribute if it is not present in the cache.

**parameters**:
· obj\_id: A string representing the unique identifier of the object.
· default\_value: The default value to be returned if the object's attribute is not found in the cache.

**Code Description**:
The get\_default function is a method of the cache class, which takes two parameters: obj\_id and default\_value. The obj\_id parameter is used to identify the object in the cache, while the default\_value parameter is the value to be returned if the object's attribute is not found in the cache.

The function does not contain any implementation details, as indicated by the "pass" statement. However, based on the function's name and its location within the cache class, we can infer its intended behavior. When called, the function likely checks the cache for the existence of the object's attribute identified by obj\_id. If the attribute is found, its value is returned. Otherwise, the default\_value parameter is returned.

**Note**:
It is important to note that the get\_default function does not modify the cache in any way. It only retrieves values from the cache or returns a default value if the attribute is not found. Developers should ensure that the cache is properly populated with the necessary data before calling this function. Additionally, the function's behavior is deterministic, meaning that it will always return the same value for the same obj\_id and default\_value parameters.
