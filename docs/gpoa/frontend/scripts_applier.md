## ClassDef scripts_applier
 **scripts\_applier**: The `scripts_applier` class is a subclass of `applier_frontend` and is responsible for handling scripts-related operations in the gpoa project. It serves as a frontend module that applies policies related to scripts.

**attributes**:
· `storage`: An instance of the storage class, which is used to interact with the Windows Registry and other storage mechanisms.
· `sid`: The security identifier (SID) of the user or machine for which policies are being applied.
· `startup_scripts`: A list of startup scripts for the current SID.
· `shutdown_scripts`: A list of shutdown scripts for the current SID.
· `folder_path`: The file path to the scripts cache folder.

**Code Description**:
The `scripts_applier` class is a subclass of `applier_frontend` and is responsible for handling scripts-related operations in the gpoa project. It initializes the `storage` and `sid` attributes in its constructor, and sets the `startup_scripts` and `shutdown_scripts` attributes based on the result of a call to `storage.get_scripts()`. The `folder_path` attribute is set to the scripts cache folder path.

The `cleaning_cache()` method removes the contents of the scripts cache folder. The `filling_cache()` method creates and updates the scripts cache folder and copies the startup and shutdown scripts to the appropriate subfolders.

The `run()` method is called by the `apply()` method and is responsible for filling the scripts cache folder with the necessary scripts.

The `apply()` method checks whether the current module is enabled before calling `run()`. If the module is enabled, it fills the scripts cache folder with the necessary scripts. If the module is not enabled, it logs a message indicating that the module is not enabled.

The `scripts_applier` class is intended to be used as a frontend module that applies policies related to scripts in the gpoa project. It is initialized with a `storage` object and a `sid`, and its `apply()` method is called to apply the necessary scripts.

The `scripts_applier` class is used in the `_init_machine_appliers()` method of the `frontend_manager` class to initialize the `scripts` key of the `machine_appliers` dictionary. This allows the `frontend_manager` class to manage and apply policies related to scripts using the `scripts_applier` class.

**Note**:
The `scripts_applier` class is intended to be used as a frontend module that applies policies related to scripts in the gpoa project. It should be initialized with a `storage` object and a `sid`, and its `apply()` method should be called to apply the necessary scripts. The `scripts_applier` class is not intended to be used directly by end-users, but rather as a component of the larger gpoa project.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, storage, sid)
 **__init__**: The function of **__init__** is to initialize the scripts applier object with the required parameters and set up the necessary attributes for the object.

**parameters**:
· storage: An instance of the SQLiteRegistry class, which provides access to the scripts registry.
· sid: A unique identifier for the user or system, which is used to filter the scripts based on the user or system.

**Code Description**:
The **__init__** function initializes the object by setting the `storage` and `sid` attributes with the provided parameters. Then, it calls the `get_scripts` method of the `storage` object to retrieve the list of startup and shutdown scripts for the given `sid`. The retrieved scripts are stored in the `startup_scripts` and `shutdown_scripts` attributes, respectively.

The function also creates a folder path for caching the scripts using the `__cache_scripts` attribute, which is a class-level attribute defined in the `scripts_applier` class. The folder path is created using the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module.

Finally, the function calls the `check_enabled` function with the `storage` object and the `__module_name` and `__module_experimental` attributes to determine whether the module is enabled or not. The `check_enabled` function returns a boolean value, which is stored in the `__module_enabled` attribute.

The `__init__` function is called when a new instance of the `scripts_applier` class is created. It sets up the necessary attributes for the object, which are used by other methods in the class to apply the scripts.

**Note**:
- The `get_scripts` method of the `storage` object is called with the `sid` and `'STARTUP'` or `'SHUTDOWN'` parameters to retrieve the startup and shutdown scripts, respectively.
- The `check_enabled` function is called with the `storage` object and the `__module_name` and `__module_experimental` attributes to determine whether the module is enabled or not.
- The `__cache_scripts` attribute is a class-level attribute defined in the `scripts_applier` class, which is used to create the folder path for caching the scripts.
- The `Path` class from the `pathlib` module is used to create the folder path for caching the scripts.
- The `__init__` function initializes the object and sets up the necessary attributes for the object, which are used by other methods in the class to apply the scripts.

### FunctionDef cleaning_cache(self)
 **cleaning\_cache**: The function of cleaning\_cache is to remove the directory tree of the folder\_path, ignoring any file or directory that is not found.

**parameters**:
· **self**: The instance of the class that the cleaning\_cache method belongs to.

**Code Description**:
The cleaning\_cache function begins by calling the log function with the message code 'D160', which logs an informational message indicating that the cache cleaning process has started.

Then, the function attempts to remove the directory tree of the folder\_path by calling the remove\_dir\_tree function, passing in the folder\_path and setting the delete\_files, delete\_folder, and delete\_sub\_folders parameters to True. This means that the function will delete all files, folders, and sub-folders within the folder\_path.

If a FileNotFoundError exception is raised, it means that the directory tree to be removed has already been removed by another process, and the function logs the message code 'D154' using the log function.

If any other exception is raised, the function creates a dictionary called logdata with the exception as the value of the 'exc' key and logs the message code 'E64' along with the logdata dictionary using the log function.

**Relation with Callers**:
The cleaning\_cache function is called by the apply function of the scripts\_applier class in the gpoa/frontend/scripts\_applier.py/scripts\_applier module. The apply function calls the cleaning\_cache function to remove the cache directory and its contents before running the module.

**Note**:
· Be cautious when using this function, as it permanently deletes files and directories. Ensure that the folder\_path parameter points to the correct directory and that the function is called only when necessary.
· The function handles the FileNotFoundError exception, but it is recommended to handle other exceptions that may occur during the removal of the directory tree.
***
### FunctionDef filling_cache(self)
 **filling\_cache**: The function of filling\_cache is to create and update folder directories for scripts and copy them to the appropriate locations based on their type (STARTUP or SHUTDOWN).

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the class that the filling\_cache method belongs to.

***
### FunctionDef run(self)
 **run**: The function of run is to execute the script application process by calling the filling\_cache function.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the class that the run method belongs to.

**Code Description**:
The run function initializes the script application process by calling the filling\_cache method, which is responsible for creating and updating folder directories for scripts and copying them to the appropriate locations based on their type (STARTUP or SHUTDOWN). This function does not take any additional arguments, as it operates on the object's state.

The run function is called within the apply method, which is responsible for the overall script application process. The apply method first calls the cleaning\_cache function to clean up any previous cache, and then checks if the module is enabled. If the module is enabled, it proceeds to call the run function, initiating the script application process.

It is important to note that the run function is only called when the module is enabled, as determined by the apply function. This ensures that the script application process is only executed when the module is in an active state.

**Note**:
- The run function should only be called within the context of the apply function, and should not be called directly.
- The run function relies on the filling\_cache function to create and update the necessary folder directories and copy the scripts. Therefore, any changes to the filling\_cache function may affect the behavior of the run function.
- The run function is only executed when the module is enabled, as determined by the apply function.
***
### FunctionDef apply(self)
 **apply**: The function of apply is to perform the script application process by cleaning the cache and executing the module if it is enabled.

## FunctionDef install_script(storage_script_entry, script_dir, access_permissions)
 **install\_script**: The function of install\_script is to copy scripts to specific directories and create directories for them if given arguments and copy them there.

**parameters**:
· storage\_script\_entry: A object that contains the script's information, such as the script's path, number, and arguments.
· script\_dir: The directory where the script will be copied.
· access\_permissions: The access permissions for the script file.

**Code Description**:

The function first creates the script directory if it doesn't exist already using the `mkdir` method. Then it creates the script file name by combining the script number (with leading zeros for a total of 5 digits) and the script's original file name. The script file is then copied to the specified directory using the `shutil.copyfile` method.

Next, the function sets the access permissions for the script file using the `os.chmod` method. If the `storage_script_entry` object contains arguments, the function creates a new directory for the arguments, creates a file for the arguments, writes the arguments to the file, and closes the file.

From a functional perspective, this function is called by two other objects in the project: `filling_cache` in `gpoa/frontend/scripts_applier.py/scripts_applier/` and `filling_cache` in `gpoa/frontend/scripts_applier.py/scripts_applier_user/`. In both cases, the function is used to copy and organize scripts in specific directories based on the script's type (STARTUP, SHUTDOWN, LOGON, or LOGOFF) and the user's username.

**Note**:

* The `storage_script_entry` object must contain the correct information for the script, including the script's path, number, and arguments.
* The `script_dir` parameter must be a valid directory path.
* The `access_permissions` parameter must be a valid octal number representing the access permissions for the script file.
* The function will create the script directory and argument directory if they do not exist.
* The function will overwrite existing script files with the same name.
* The function does not check if the script file is executable or not after setting the access permissions.
* The function does not check if the argument file is closed properly or not after writing the arguments to the file.
