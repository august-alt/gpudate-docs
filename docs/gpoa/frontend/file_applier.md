## ClassDef file_applier
 **file_applier**: The function of the `file_applier` class is to handle file-related operations in the gpoa project. It is a subclass of `applier_frontend` and provides specific implementation for file-related policy application.

**Attributes**:
- `storage`: An instance of the storage class, which is used to interact with the Windows Registry and other storage mechanisms.
- `file_cache`: A file cache object used for storing files temporarily.
- `sid`: The security identifier (SID) of the user or machine for which policies are being applied.
- `files`: A list of files to be applied, initialized in the constructor by calling `self.storage.get_files(self.sid)`.
- `__module_name`: The name of the module, set to 'FilesApplier'.
- `__module_experimental`: A flag indicating if the module is experimental, set to True.
- `__module_enabled`: A flag indicating if the module is enabled, initialized in the constructor by calling `check_enabled(self.storage, self.__module_name, self.__module_experimental)`.

**Code Description**:
The `file_applier` class is a subclass of `applier_frontend` and provides specific implementation for file-related policy application. The constructor initializes the `storage`, `exe_check`, `sid`, `file_cache`, and `files` attributes. It also sets the `__module_enabled` attribute based on the result of a call to `check_enabled()`.

The `run()` method iterates through the `files` list and calls `Files_cp(file, self.file_cache, self.exe_check)` for each file, which is responsible for copying the file to the file cache and performing execution checks.

The `apply()` method checks if the module is enabled by evaluating `self.__module_enabled`. If it is enabled, the `run()` method is called to apply the policies. Otherwise, a log message 'D168' is generated.

**Note**:
The `file_applier` class is intended to be used as a part of the gpoa project for handling file-related policy application. It is a subclass of `applier_frontend` and provides specific implementation for file-related policy application. When using this class, ensure that the required attributes are properly initialized and that the class is used within the context of the gpoa project.

The `file_applier` class is instantiated and added to the `machine_appliers` dictionary in the `_init_machine_appliers` method of the `frontend_manager` class. This allows the gpoa application to manage and apply policies for files using the `file_applier` class.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, storage, file_cache, sid)
 **__init__**: The function of **__init__** is to initialize the file applier object with the necessary parameters and attributes.

**parameters**:
· `storage`: An object that provides access to the storage where the files are located.
· `file_cache`: An object that provides access to the file cache.
· `sid`: A security identifier (SID) that is used to filter the files based on their SID.

**Code Description**:
The **__init__** function initializes the file applier object by setting the `storage`, `file_cache`, and `sid` attributes. It then retrieves the list of files associated with the given SID using the `get_files` method of the `storage` object. The function also initializes an `Execution_check` object using the `storage` object to check the execution status of files in the storage.

The `__module_enabled` attribute is set to the result of the `check_enabled` function, which checks if the module is enabled or not based on the storage and the name of the module. The `check_enabled` function is defined in the `applier_frontend.py` module and takes three parameters: `storage`, `module_name`, and `module_experimental`.

The `__module_name` and `__module_experimental` attributes are not defined in the `__init__` function, but they are used in the `check_enabled` function. Therefore, it is assumed that they are defined elsewhere in the `file_applier` class.

The `__init__` function is called when a new `file_applier` object is created. It is used to set up the necessary attributes and objects required for the file applier to function properly.

**Note**:
- The `storage` parameter should be a valid storage object that provides access to the storage where the files are located.
- The `file_cache` parameter should be a valid file cache object that provides access to the file cache.
- The `sid` parameter should be a valid SID in the format of S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxx.
- The `Execution_check` object is initialized with the `storage` object to check the execution status of files in the storage.
- The `check_enabled` function is used to check if the module is enabled or not based on the storage and the name of the module. The `__module_name` and `__module_experimental` attributes are used in this function.

**Code Description**:
The file\_applier\_user class is a subclass of applier\_frontend class and is used to apply policies related to files for a specific user. It inherits the attributes and methods from the applier\_frontend class and adds some additional attributes and methods to provide the actual policy application logic for files.

The \_\_init\_\_() method initializes the storage, file\_cache, sid, username, exe\_check attributes, and sets the \_\_module\_enabled attribute based on the result of a call to check\_enabled() method. The check\_enabled() method checks whether the current module is enabled in the gpoa configuration, and returns True if it is, and False otherwise.

The run() method applies the files for the user by calling the Files\_cp() method for each file in the files list.

The admin\_context\_apply() method is intended to be called in the admin context, it checks whether the module is enabled or not, if it is enabled, it calls the run() method to apply the files for the user, otherwise, it does nothing.

The user\_context\_apply() method is intended to be called in the user context, but it doesn't have any implementation in this class, so it does nothing.

The \_\_module\_name\_\_, \_\_module\_experimental\_\_, and \_\_module\_enabled\_\_ attributes are used by the gpoa application to determine whether the current module should be loaded and applied.

The file\_applier\_user class is used by the frontend\_manager class to apply policies related to files for a specific user. It is instantiated with the storage, file\_cache, sid, and username parameters and added to the user\_appliers dictionary with the key 'files' in the _init\_user\_appliers() method of the frontend\_manager class.

**Note**:
The file\_applier\_user class is intended to be used in the gpoa project to apply policies related to files for a specific user. Subclasses should not override the user\_context\_apply() and admin\_context\_apply() methods, but they can override the run() method to provide the actual policy application logic for files. Subclasses should also set the \_\_module\_name\_\_, \_\_module\_experimental\_\_, and \_\_module\_enabled\_\_ attributes appropriately.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, storage, file_cache, sid, username)
 **__init__**: The function of **__init__** is to initialize the file\_applier\_user object with the necessary parameters and attributes.
