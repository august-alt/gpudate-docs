## ClassDef nodomain_backend
 **nodomain_backend**: The function of the `nodomain_backend` class is to serve as a specific implementation of the `applier_backend` abstract base class, handling the retrieval and storage of Group Policy Objects (GPOs) settings in non-domain environments.

**attributes**:
- `domain`: Set to `None` by default. This attribute is not used in the `nodomain_backend` class.
- `machine_name`: A string representing the machine name. It is initialized with the value returned by the `get_machine_name()` function.
- `machine_sid`: A string representing the machine's security identifier (SID). It is initialized with the value returned by the `get_sid()` function, using the `domain` and `machine_name` attributes.
- `storage`: An instance of the `registry_factory('registry')` class. It is used to store and manage GPO settings.
- `username`: A string representing the machine name. It is used to work with the HKCU hive.
- `sid`: A string representing the machine's SID. It is used to work with the HKCU hive.

**Code Description**:
The `nodomain_backend` class is a concrete implementation of the `applier_backend` abstract base class, specifically designed for non-domain environments. It initializes its attributes during instantiation, including the `domain`, `machine_name`, `machine_sid`, `storage`, `username`, and `sid`.

The `nodomain_backend` class overrides the `retrieve_and_store` method from the `applier_backend` class. This method is responsible for retrieving GPO settings and storing them in a database. In the `nodomain_backend` class, the `retrieve_and_store` method performs the following tasks:

1. It initializes the `local_policy` object by calling the `get_local_gpt()` function with the `sid` attribute as its argument.
2. It merges the machine and user policies by calling the `merge_machine()` and `merge_user()` methods of the `local_policy` object.
3. It wipes the HKLM and HKCU hives by calling the `wipe_hklm()` and `wipe_user()` methods of the `storage` object, using the `machine_sid` attribute as its argument.

**Relationship with derived classes**:
The `nodomain_backend` class is a direct implementation of the `applier_backend` abstract base class, providing a specific way to handle GPO settings in non-domain environments.

**Note**:
- The `nodomain_backend` class is not meant to be instantiated directly. Instead, it is instantiated through the `backend_factory()` function in the `gpoa/backend/__init__.py` file.
- The `retrieve_and_store` method should be implemented in derived classes to provide the actual logic for retrieving and storing GPO settings. In this case, the `nodomain_backend` class provides a specific implementation for non-domain environments.
- The `nodomain_backend` class is part of the `gpoa` project, which handles the retrieval and storage of GPO settings in various environments, including non-domain, FreeIPA, and Samba environments.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**: The function of **__init__** is to initialize the nodomain\_backend object with necessary attributes.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
Â· None: The **__init__** function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The **__init__** function initializes the nodomain\_backend object with the following attributes:

1. `domain`: This attribute is initialized to `None`.
2. `machine_name`: This attribute is set to the localhost name looking like `DC0$` by calling the `get_machine_name` function from the `util` package.
3. `machine_sid`: This attribute is set to the SID (Security Identifier) for the local machine by calling the `get_sid` function from the `sid` module in the `util` package. The `get_sid` function takes three parameters: `domain`, `machine_name`, and `is_machine`. In this case, the `domain` parameter is set to `None`, the `machine_name` parameter is set to the value of the `machine_name` attribute, and the `is_machine` parameter is set to `True`.
4. `storage`: This attribute is set to an instance of the `sqlite_registry` object by calling the `registry_factory` function with the `registry` parameter.

After setting the above attributes, the `set_info` method of the `storage` object is called to set the following information:

1. `domain`: This information is set to the value of the `domain` attribute.
2. `machine_name`: This information is set to the value of the `machine_name` attribute.
3. `machine_sid`: This information is set to the value of the `machine_sid` attribute.

Finally, the `username` and `sid` attributes are set to the `machine_name` and `machine_sid` attributes, respectively.

**Relationship with its callees in the project**:
The `__init__` function calls the `get_machine_name` function from the `util` package to set the `machine_name` attribute. It also calls the `get_sid` function from the `sid` module in the `util` package to set the `machine_sid` attribute.

The `__init__` function creates an instance of the `sqlite_registry` object by calling the `registry_factory` function with the `registry` parameter.

The `set_info` method of the `storage` object is called to set the `domain`, `machine_name`, and `machine_sid` information in the `sqlite_registry` object.

**Note**:
None.

### FunctionDef retrieve_and_store(self)
 **retrieve\_and\_store**: The function of retrieve\_and\_store is to retrieve settings and store them in a database.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The retrieve\_and\_store function is a method of the nodomain\_backend class, which is defined in the gpoa/backend/nodomain\_backend.py file. It performs the following steps:

1. Wipe the HKLM and machine\_sid user settings in the storage object by calling the wipe\_hklm and wipe\_user functions of the sqlite\_registry object, respectively.
2. Get the local GPT object for the machine SID by calling the get\_local\_gpt function and passing in the machine SID as an argument.
3. Merge the machine and user settings of the local GPT object to the storage object by calling the merge\_machine and merge\_user functions of the local GPT object, respectively.

The wipe\_hklm function deletes all records in the HKLM table of the SQLite database, effectively wiping out all the entries in the HKLM hive of the Windows registry. The wipe\_user function deletes all records associated with a given user from the SQLite database.

The get\_local\_gpt function converts the default policy to GPT and creates an object out of it, with the name set to 'Local Policy'. It then returns the GPT object.

The merge\_machine function merges machine settings to storage, while the merge\_user function merges user settings to storage.

The retrieve\_and\_store function is called by the retrieve\_and\_store method of the backend object, which is defined in the gpoa/backend/backend.py file. The backend object calls the retrieve\_and\_store method of the appropriate backend object (nodomain\_backend or samba\_backend) based on the type of user (machine or user).

**Note**:
- The retrieve\_and\_store function should only be called by the retrieve\_and\_store method of the backend object.
- The retrieve\_and\_store function should only be called after all records have been retrieved and stored in the database.
- The retrieve\_and\_store function should not be called if the user has not been authenticated.

Here's an example of how to use the retrieve\_and\_store function in the retrieve\_and\_store method of the backend object:

```python
backend = nodomain_backend()
backend.retrieve_and_store()
```

In this example, the retrieve\_and\_store function is called on an instance of the nodomain\_backend class. The function retrieves the settings and stores them in the database.
